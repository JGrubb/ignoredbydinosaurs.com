<blockquote>
CouchDB takes quite a few lessons learned from The Web, but there is one thing that sucks about the web: latency. Whenever you have to wait for an application to respond or a website to render you almost always wait for a network connection that isn’t as fast as you want it at that point. Waiting a few seconds instead of milliseconds greatly influences user experience and thus user-satisfaction.

Worse: what do you do when you are offline. This happens all the time, your DSL or cable provider has issues, your iPhone, G1 or Blackberry has no bars. No connectivity, no way to get to your data.

CouchDB can solve this scenario as well and this is where scaling is important again. This time it is scaling down. Imagine CouchDB installed on phones and other mobile devices that can synchronize data with centrally hosted CouchDB’s when they are on a network. The synchronization is not bound by user interface contraints like sub-second response times. It is easier to tune for high bandwidth and higher latency than for low bandwidth and very low latency. Mobile applications can then use the local CouchDB to fetch data and since no remote networking is required for that, latency is low by default.

But CouchDB on a phone, can it be done? Erlang, CouchDB’s implementation language has been designed to run on embedded devices magnitudes smaller and less powerful than today’s phones.
