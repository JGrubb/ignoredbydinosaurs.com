		<p>May I suggest you download this book -- <a href='http://learnpythonthehardway.com/index'>Learn Python the Hard Way</a>?  It's got instructions in the very first bit about getting a decent, free text editor installed.  TextEdit that comes with the Mac leaves quite a bit to be desired, and though I haven't personally checked out <a href='http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/'>GEdit</a>, I'm sure it's a step up.  Of course if you think you might want to get serious about this, or if you get serious about this down the line, may I suggest dropping $60 on <a href='http://macromates.com/'>TextMate</a>?  I know it's kind of a lot of money, but if you get into this stuff, it's worth it.</p><p>May I also suggest that you go through the first few exercises?  It's fun to make your computer do things, however rudimentary, and doing them in the babystep fashion that this has you do eases you into programming geekery like the command line.  It trains your fingers, it trains your eyes.  It's like that part in Rocky 4 where he goes to Siberia to toughen up against Drago.</p><p>Back soon.  Cheers.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/11/lets-try-something" title="Permalink">Let's try something.</a></h2>
		<p>Does anybody here want to build something?  My buddy Jimmy of This Blog fame laid an idea on me the other night.  He's a teacher, and a fairly progressive, observant one at that.  I believe him when he says that there's nothing out there like this kinda simple, cool idea that he had.  I think it must exist somewhere but it's not being properly promoted if it does.  So, I thought maybe it'd be a cool idea to try and teach him a little something about web development, and teach myself a lot in the process.  There's no way that this idea of his is currently within my grasp since a big part of the concept is an iOS app, but I don't think the overall idea is really that far outside the realm of possibility.  It's going to need a web backend to it, anyway.  So let's see.  Where to start?</p><p>I think we'll build it in Rails since I've learned enough about programming to know that I prefer Ruby as a language to PHP.  I think this idea could easily be done in Drupal (a large, flexible content management system that's built in PHP) as well, but for some reason the aesthetic of building the solution you need and no more is really appealing to me.  Drupal takes care of a LOT of the stuff that we're going to need to do upfront, things like user authentication (accounts) and interacting with a variety of different protocols - essential if the app phase is ever going to work.  Drupal and Rails are both just pieces of software that run databases for you, but the difference is sorta like the difference between buying a really good loaf of bread and baking a really good loaf of bread.  It doesn't make you any less of a chef to serve the store bought loaf to your guests, but if you have the time and you know how to bake a good loaf (or if it's just something you want to get good at), you're going to prefer that route.</p><p>Step one is getting Rails installed on your computer which, if you bought a Mac is made significantly easier.  We'll do that next.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/10/thursday-morning-coffee-n00b-developer-domains-and-hosting" title="Permalink">Thursday morning coffee with the n00b developer - domains and hosting</a></h2>
		<p>Welcome back to another installment of the newby web developer series.  This morning's entry comes once again from our buddy Jimmy, who the two of you reading might know as the highly technically inclined CT robo-teacher.  He'll probably be reforming the state of education in your state soon.  </p><blockquote>What's up fool.

My friend wants me to build him a simple site using wordpress. He already owns the domain name.

My question is, once I build the site using MAMP, and get everything upload to our host, how does the domain name get transferred? Is that something we have to handle or the host handles.

Thanks,
Jimmy</blockquote><p>Calling me a fool is his way of showing affection.  So, the answer is that "it depends".  If your buddy went the "get your domain free with a year's webhosting" route that many larger webhosts encourage you to do, then you don't have to do anything.  If your buddy bought the domain on the open market through a registrar such as GoDaddy, you have to dive into the scary, subterranean world of DNS.</p><p>DNS stands for Domain Name System.  A perhaps less-than-100%-accurate description --</p><p>When you buy a domain name, it's sort of like buying a spot in the world's internet phone book.  That is to say that the address <a href='http://johnnygrubb.com/'>http://johnnygrubb.com</a> is actually an "abstraction" of the information that a computer needs to complete your browser's request to get my webpage to come up.  What my computer needs to know is the IP address of the server where http://johnnygrubb.com lives.  The Domain Name System does that for you.</p><p>If you need to look up the phone number of Newtown Chinese Restaurant in Newton, you go to the phone book, look for Newtown Chinese Restaurant and move your eye to the right to get the phone number.  If you want to go to any website, you enter the address in your browser, which takes the request and hits the nearest DNS server to find the actual IP address of the webhost so the requested page can be grabbed.  It's the job of the owner of the domain name to make sure that the "phone number" or IP address is correct.</p><p>If you've bought your domain name as part of a package, then you don't need to do anything.  The webhost actually owns the domain name and is letting you use it.  This has pros and cons obviously, the pros being that they handle all of this DNS stuff for you.</p><p>If you've bought the domain name separately, you need to give that name a "phone number" so that DNS knows who to call when you request a page from that site.  That's done by getting deep into your Domain Control Panel (or something like depending on the registrar) and and finding the "Nameserver" controls.  This is where you give your domain name an address.  It's usually in an english readable form, for instance, one of the nameservers for my hosting account is <code>ns1.mediatemple.com</code>.  That means that when a request is made for a page on this site, DNS says "don't look at me, go talk to Media Temple's nameservers.  They know where to find that page."  Once the request gets to Media Temple, their nameservers say "the page you seek is at 64.207.129.18", which is the IP address of the actual server on which this site is plopped.</p><p>So, to extend the analogy a little further, a DNS lookup is actually more like that movie where the kids are trying to find the super-cool party, only to get to the party they have to drive all over town from one destination to the next before they are finally given the actual address.  For real fun, type this is your Terminal --</p><code>traceroute http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com</code><p>This command will show you all of the different "nodes" out there on the web that your request hits before it actually arrives at it's destination, my webhost.</p><p>So, the tl;dr is that if he bought the domain name through a webhost as part of a hosting package, you don't need to do anything.  If he bought the domain name on it's own, you need to go to the Domain Control Panel or the Domain Manager or whatever it's called where it was registered.  In there somewhere is a setting for the nameservers.  On the webhost's end, you'll find what their nameservers are (usually something like ns1.awesomewebhost.com and ns2.awesomewebhost.com) and put that information into the proper fields on the registrar end.  There's always at least 2 nameservers at every host because like all servers, they can go down and if they both go down your site will be unavailable.  It happens.</p><p>Changing nameserver information is like firing an MX missile.  There is no "undo".  There is no recalling the missile.  Once you push the button to change the nameservers, that change of address starts filtering out to the rest of the world's DNS servers so that the request can be sent to the proper IP address.  This filtering-out process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending.  Once it's done, the whole world will be pointed to the party on your server.</p>

		<p>My vet just recently joined the 21st century and moved all of their records from big, brown paper files to a computer system.  Her husband is an IT guy so he did the research and picked out all the computers, networked them together and set up this software system for the office.

Clients, their pets, their pets' histories, etc.  Then I thought, well, that's kinda ballsy for a vet's office to let a web service store data like that, and what if you want to move, etc.  Well, okay, how about some kind of export API etc.  Then I thought, well what about hosting the database at the client end...</p><p>Would this be a case for something like CouchDB or MongoDB?  A local datastore, and I would provide the processing and the upkeep?  I dunno.  I'm gonna sleep on it.  Sounds like a fun little project in any case...</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/10/slightly-more-depth-wordpress" title="Permalink">Slightly more in depth with Wordpress</a></h2>
		<blockquote>I am having a blast.  I found a nice photo gallery Gen Next - has lots of cool features; still working on it.

I do need some help:

1) how do I keep the 'home' page of the WP site clear of posts?  I just want to put some html text and links.  It seems to always show the latest posts.  I need to understand what is going on with that page.

2) How can I order the posts within a category.  example:  For Lyrics I have category per album with a post for each song.  I need to order them in track order, it seems to always put the newest post first.  Ordering by permalink would work since I put the track number as the 1st part of the name.

3) Gotta turn off the right nav stuff - not needed.

I tried creating a category called Lyrics and then adding sub-categories for each album.  That created the Lyrics page with all songs listed, I wanted just links to the sub-categories; plus it made the menu real ugly with all the albums listed below main menu.  I resolved this by making Lyrics a page and putting links to the 'album' categories in the html.  It seems to work fine but I am not sure if I could have done this another way.

also:  where do I comment out the 'add comments' stuff?
</blockquote><p>Alright, in order --</p><ol>
<li>Go to Settings -> Reading and set the top option to display a static page as the home page.  You'll have a list of options for which static page you want.</li>
<li>As with almost any programming challenge, there are a couple of ways to go about it.  I'm not exactly sure how you want them to display in every situation, but I'll take a beginning guess.
<ol>
<li>The easiest, and in this case probably best way to go is to just make sure you enter the lyrics for the songs in the reverse order than how you want them to appear.  If you've already entered some of them in, you can alter the "published date" on the edit screen of each lyric page.  I'd just edit that have them line up in the order that you want.</li>
<li>The more stylish option would be to write a function in your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.  To make this work correctly you'd have to make use of the "custom fields" feature.  I'm a tiny bit rusty on the exact way to go about this, but basically "custom fields" are extra bits of metadata that you can add to any page or post in WP.  For instance, you could create one custom field with a key called "track number" and use the value of that field to define the track number.  You'd then figure out the correct function to call with the correct arguments to make it show up in the right order when someone came to the lyrics section of the site.</li>
<li>Doing the same thing from the theme template would also be an option, and probably a little more realistic since you'd be able to have the correct template called by following the naming convention for a given category.  <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy'>This page</a> will tell you how.</li>
<li>Slightly off-topic, but there's also the option of creating a blanket "Lyrics" category, and then creating a post for each album that simply lists the songs in the running order, and then links the song titles to another post that contains the lyrics for that song.  This option might give you the most control for the least effort.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>So you don't need a right sidebar at all?</li>
<li>Right, yeah I would ditch the sub-categories for the albums, and probably go with option 4 above.</li>
<li>If you look at <a href='http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme/blob/master//page.php'>line 29 on the page.php</a> file and <a href='http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme/blob/master//single.php'>line 39 on the single.php</a> file, you'll see the comment function.  I'd just comment it out so it reads -

<code>&lt;?php //comments_template( '', true ); ?&gt;</code><br />
and your comments will be gone.</li>
</ol>

		<h2><a href="/2010/10/more-wordpress" title="Permalink">More on Wordpress</a></h2>
		<p>This one is for my buddy, Bob.  Bob is an old school developer who has recently been baptized by the cooling waters of the web.  He's building a site in Wordpress, so I thought I'd post a few relevant pieces of info up here for him, and those of his ilk.</p><p>First of all, realize that Posts and Pages are almost the exact same thing.  The key difference between the two as far as I can tell is not that Pages are easier to add to the top-level navigation, but that Posts allow you to classify them with "Categories".  This allows Wordpress to work it's relational database magic, and in the hands of a skilled template author you can really take a very simple system and make it produce just about any listing of content that you want.  When in the early stages of developing a site, it's better to take what you'd think of as top-level content items and see if there's any way that you can make it a listing of Posts in a certain Category, rather than just dumping related info on one Page.  The chief advantages of working this way are maintenance and search-ability.</p><p>The <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/'>Wordpress Codex</a> is a wonderfully organized place to learn a lot about authoring templates.  Most of the Wordpress core is basically just a large group of functions for talking to a database, and much of the magic of pulling the info back out in the way that you want it is in the template layer.  Thus, the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation'>Theme Development</a> section of the Codex is the place to spend a couple of days getting used to the way Wordpress works.</p><p>I'd suggest downloading my very <a href='http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme'>bare bones base theme</a> and stepping through some of the template files while browsing the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags'>Template Tags function reference</a>.  It may not make sense immediately, but it won't take long.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/09/my-little-ponys-first-shell-script" title="Permalink">My little pony's first shell script</a></h2>
		<p>So I've been doing a lot of CMS work lately, both Drupal and Wordpress.  The Wordpress gigs seem to come and go within a week, and are mostly just banging together a theme with varying amounts of complexity.  I'm a recent convert to the 960.gs CSS framework, which makes the absolute quickest work of laying out a website.  It's a thing of beauty and I've actually <a href='http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme'>created my own base theme</a> to make the work even quicker, but that's for another post.</p><p>Every one of these gigs requires the exact same setup - downloading various bits of software from all over the internet and copying them to specific places on my hard drive and then wiring them all together.  It's a time consuming and utterly repetitive process, which makes it perfect for a computer to do.  Even more perfect is that I'm already on a computer when I'm doing it!  Wow...</p><p>I'd already taken to doing much of this work from the "command line", and it only occurred to me yesterday that if I were doing the exact same series of commands from the command line every time I set one of these things up, isn't that something I could write a "script" to do for me?  For those of you - a "script" is exactly what it sounds like.  In the most basic sense all computer programs are scripts, be they <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/chapter1b'>compiled scripts or interpreted scripts</a>.  You must tell the computer what to do in no uncertain terms at all times for all possible scenarios.  Failure to do so is a Bad Thing.  So in this sense, I'm writing a series of terminal commands in the same order every time.  I had no idea until yesterday that it was as simple as saving those commands into a file and running that file to get what I want done.</p><p>So, about 20-30 minutes worth of downloading, copying, and renaming has been reduced to about 20-30 seconds, depending on bandwidth.  Here's the script, in case you're curious --</p><code>
#!/bin/sh

wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz<br />
tar xzvf latest.tar.gz<br />
rm latest.tar.gz<br />
echo "Name of directory?"<br />
read directory<br />
mv wordpress $directory<br />
cd $directory/wp-content/themes<br />
wget http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme/tarball/master<br />
tar xzvf JGrubb-Base-WP-theme-0efd724.tar.gz<br />
rm JGrubb-Base-WP-theme-0efd724.tar.gz<br />
mv JGrubb-Base-WP-theme-0efd724 ibd<br />

</code><p>Now I'm off to write a script to do the same thing for me for Drupal...</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/09/keeping-it" title="Permalink">Keeping it up</a></h2>
		<p>Well, the hardest thing about blogging is not having things to say, but finding the time to write them down.  And oddly, when I do find the time to write them down, I have very little to say.  This is no exception...</p><p>There's a blogger out there named <a href='http://dashes.com/anil/'>Anil Dash</a>, who I first stumbled across at the Gathering by the River over there in Yarmony Creek territory.  His bio is on the site, but he worked for Six Apart, a company that made some of the first mass-used blogging software.  Their main platform is/was called <a href='http://www.movabletype.com/'>Movable Type</a>.  Moveable Type powers Daring Fireball, I believe, and has mostly had it's lunch eaten by Wordpress.  Six Apart has recently been bought by some larger company, and that's not what this post is about so I'll skip the details.</p><p>Six Apart was one of the few venture capital funded software companies to have been birthed in the wake of the Clinton era technology bubble (or the bursting of said bubble, to be more accurate).  The founding of the company is profiled in the excellent book <a href='http://www.foundersatwork.com/'>Founders at Work</a>, one of the few cover-to-cover-interesting business books I've ever read, and the only one on the Apress imprint.  I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in how some of these more modern web startups got their start, as well as some interesting backstory on Apple, Adobe, and a bunch more early 80's innovators that you've probably never heard of.  There's a section on Evan Williams, one of the really smart founders of Twitter, only the profile was written about three years ago, when he was known as one of the really smart founders of Blogger.  Rather amazing.</p><p>And cue the crying baby.</p><p>Anyway, my point was that Anil's blog has seen a lot more interesting action lately, which is cool because he's got some really interesting takes on some of the business out there and the culture that goes with it. Enjoy.</p><p>jg</p>

The iPad is so cool I still haven't had the opportunity to play with one yet, but from a hundred miles up it's still just one of the bazillion devices that fall into the terrifically broad and jam-packed category of "gadgets to read stuff on the internet".  "<a href='http://unsuck-it.com/consume-content/'>Consume content</a>" is the hipster way of saying it.  It's an obviously lucrative market, which is why it gets the attention of so many innovators.  Well and good, but what about people who "produce content", we'll call them writers and publishers from now on...</p><p>I finally experimented today with a service that I signed up for several months ago but never spent the 45 minutes to learn how to get it going.  It's called <a href='http://typekit.com/'>Typekit</a>.  The idea is <em>so</em> simple and <em>so</em> brilliant.  Allow me...</p><code>&lt;geek content &lt;!--feel free to skip ahead--&gt; &gt;</code><p>There's a fundamental issue when you're building a website that most people probably aren't aware of at all.  The issue is the limited number of fonts that you can reliably use to set the type on said website.  The vast majority of the world is browsing your site on a Windows computer with a standard set of fonts installed on it. Yes, fonts are installed on your computer.  It's a weird concept.  When you browse to a website, that website tells your browser what font it would prefer to have used when the browser shows you that webpage.  It's not at all uncommon for the designer to want to use a font that's not installed on that computer.  There are only about a dozen or so "<a href='http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html'>web-safe fonts</a>" that you can rely on, and it gets old really fast using those same fonts over and over and over.  If the designer wants to work outside that box a little he may ask the browser to call a more exotic font, but he'll also specify what he wants used if that font doesn't exist on the user's computer.  Confused yet?  An example perhaps...</p><p style='font-family:arial'>This is a sentence set in Arial.</p><p style='font-family:&apos;lucida grande&apos;'>This is a sentence set in Lucida Grande</p><p style='font-family:georgia'>This is a sentence set in Georgia</p><p style='font-family:&apos;courier new&apos;'>This is a sentence set in Courier New</p><p>That's all cool, but what if you want to use something more exotic to give the name of the site <a href='http://twitter.com/'>a bit more branded flair</a>?  Well, in the case of Twitter and most every other website on Earth that means firing up Photoshop and making it there.  You get many more fonts to choose from and you can always make your own if you want.  Photoshop then spits out your cool text as an image.  Yes, that Twitter logo is an image, not HTML text.  That means that every browser renders it just like you want it, but it also means that it's a relative pain to change and that search engines can't tell what it says unless you fill in a bunch of info about it.  HTML is preferable for anything that's meant to be read, but then you only get those dozen fonts.  Double rainbow of a bummer.</p><p>So Typekit has a service that lets you use a whole bunch of different fonts, served up to every browser that's reasonably modern.  I won't bore you with the details (that's for another post), but it's a serious lifesaver.  I'm working on a site right now and <span style='font-family:&apos;myriad pro&apos;'>my favorite Myriad Pro</span> just ain't doin' it for the site header when it's set 3 inches tall.  For a variety of reasons I didn't want to go to Photoshop, so I dove in and tried out Typekit.  I soon came upon a cool font called</p><p>Not exactly what the designer used, but vastly more stylish than Myriad.</p><code>&lt;/geek content&gt;</code><p>Now, here's why this is cool for all of us.  Services like this are actually starting to focus on the "production" end of the content business.  That's a very good thing for all of us.  That means that the web is finally hitting puberty as a publishing medium.  <a href='http://takeoutphoto.blogspot.com/2008/09/psychology-of-typeface.html'>There's a reason that there are a million different fonts in the world</a>, because an all Courier world would be very boring indeed.  It's a terrible thing that most websites only get a choice of a dozen different fonts, but it's a wonderful thing that someone is putting their head toward solving this problem for us all.  I personally think that this is a BIG market waiting to happen.  Get in now.</p><p>Speaking of BIG markets waiting to happen, has anyone tried out <a href='https://www.greplin.com/'>Greplin</a> yet?</p>

<p>So now we have a situation where the access providers want to change the game. And they are seeking the regulatory approval to do just that.</p>

<p>Venture backed startups and venture capitalists don't use regulations and lobbying as competitive advantages. We don't have armies of lobbyists. We don't have congress on our payroll. But the access providers certainly do. They have been regulated for a long time. They know how the game is played and they use it to their advantage. Regulation is their game. They want our government to regulate the Internet and they want those regulations written in a way that allows them to do what they want to do. A regulated Internet is a comforting thought to the access providers and a frightening thought to entrepreneurs and the ecosystem around them.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>There is a lot of debate and discussion going on in Washington, Silicon Valley, New York City, and all around the country right now about net neutrality and regulating the Internet. We have big companies with huge vested interests making proposals that are heavyweight and <a href='http://www.unionsquareventures.com/2010/08/a-threat-to-startups.php'>are not startup friendly</a>. We don't need Google, Verizon, AT&T, or anyone else telling us how to regulate the Internet. <strong>We don't need pages and pages of rules written by lawyers that will employ lawyers for years to come.</strong> </p>

<p>We just need to choose not to discriminate on the web and thereby maintain the way the Internet works today. I hope that everyone will come to their senses and realize that is the simplest, easiest, and best path forward.</p>

I actually think the interface is better on the iPhone app.  All the information you need is right there, and it's as intuitively laid out as it could possibly be.  You can track your order, the search is fantastic and all of the product reviews are right there.  Unfortunately, due to the rules in the iPhone SDK and the restrictions that Apple places on iPhone developers, you can't download music from Amazon to your iPhone.  There's nothing preventing this feature from a technical standpoint, though Apple would argue that outside developers might write crappy software that would degrade the performance of blah blah blah.  I don't think Amazon writes crappy software.  The only real reason is to prevent competition.</p><p>iTunes is the "largest seller of music on the planet".  I'm not in the mood to do any research on the market share of the iPod and the iPhone in terms of smartphones and mp3 players, but it's obviously substantial.  In terms of mobile delivery of digital music, it's a virtual monopoly.</p><p>If/when the DOJ (or more likely the EU) starts making noise about opening anti-trust charges against Apple to force it open it's platform up a little bit, I'll be cheering them on.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/07/installing-drush-on-media-temple-grid-server" title="Permalink">Installing Drush on Media Temple Grid Server</a></h2>
		<p><a href='http://drupal.org/project/drush'>Drush</a> is a tool for working on Drupal websites.  It's technically filed away on Drupal.org as a "module", but it's not exactly a module.  It's more like an add-on for your webserver setup, either <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2010/01/newby-web-programmer-episode-1/'>development</a> or production, that adds some really useful tools for managing your Drupal website.  For instance, those of you familiar with Wordpress might be surprised to know that Drupal has no built in facility for updating either the core Drupal code or any of the add-ons (which go by the name "Plug-ins" in Wordpress and "Modules" in Drupal).  I don't have any statistics to back this up, but I think the average Drupal site is built with many more of these open-source-and-constantly-shifting contributions than the typical Wordpress site.</p><p><span class='highlight'>What all that means is that Drupal is a pain in the ass to maintain</span>.  When one of your modules has an update, you get a message that tells you so.  These messages come all the time.  They never stop, actually.  And there's no way to make them go away except to go and download the latest version(s) and upload it/them to the server over FTP, hope nothing went wrong with the transfer, and then go and update your DB, more or less manually.  Over time, slackness can set in.</p><p>I've been reading about it for several weeks because the most interesting thing it does (to me now) is take care of updating your stuff.  The downside for some is that it's a command line tool.  However, if you like the command line because it makes you feel like a real programmer, you're in luck!  <code>drush up</code>  updates your site, modules and all by downloading them straight from the Drupal CVS repository, and then running any DB updates for you.  "Magic", you might say had you been deprived of this after having tasted Wordpress' sweet waters.</p><p>I haven't even used it yet, but I spent the last two days figuring our how to install it, and found the answer scattered over 3 or 4 different places.  Maybe I'm the only one, but I figured I'd make it a little easier for the next guy.</p><ol>
<li>Make sure you <a href='http://kb.mediatemple.net/questions/16/Connecting+via+SSH+to+your+(gs)+Grid-Service'>know how to use SSH</a> on your grid server account, and log in.</li>
<li>You will now be at the command line.  You want to make sure you are in the home directory, so type:<br />
<code>cd ~/</code></li>
<li>At this point you'll create a folder for stuff that you install to live in.  Type:<br />
<code>mkdir bin</code>, and then switch into that directory:<br />
<code>cd bin</code></li>
<li>This command fetches it from drupal.org for you:<br />
<code>wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drush-All-versions-3.0-beta1.tar.gz</code><br />
in tarball form.</li>
<li>Untar:<br />
<code>tar xzvf drush-All-versions-3.0-beta1.tar.gz</code></li>
<li>Switch into the new <code>drush</code> folder:<br />
<code>cd drush</code></li>
<li>Take a look at the contents of that folder by typing <code>ls</code> and make sure everything looks like this:
<code>LICENSE.txt  commands  drush.api.php  drush.info  drush_logo-black.png  example.drushrc.php
README.txt   drush     drush.bat      drush.php   example.drush.inc     includes
</code></li>
<li>Note the path to that folder by typing:
<code>pwd</code>.  <br />
You'll get something back like: <code>/home/70298/users/.home/bin/drush</code>.<br />
The drush command is at the end of that path, and you have to let the server know that now.<br />
Note that everything before <code>bin</code> can be replaced with <code>~/</code>.</li>
<li>Switch back to your FTP client and root around in your server for the "home" folder.  It's going to be back toward the root:<br /><code>cd ~/users</code></li>
<li>You may or may not see a file named <code>.bash_profile</code>.  Note that it might be hidden depending on your FTP client.  If you are sure that it's not there, create a file and give it that name.</li>
<li>MT runs PHP4 on the command line by default.  You have to specifically tell it to run Drush with PHP5.  Thus, paste this into the file you just created (<code>.bash_profile</code>).<br />
<code>alias drush='/usr/bin/php5 ~/bin/drush/drush.php'</code></li>
<li><code>source .bash_profile</code> to reload the <code>.bash_profile</code> file.</li>
<li>God willing, if you type in <code>drush</code> at this point you are going to get a long list of newly available commands.</li>

</ol><p>Note that this took me over a month of poking and prodding to get working correctly.  Specifically, in contrast to all the Drush installation tutorials I found out there, I had to specifically direct it to the <code>drush.php</code> file, rather than the generic <code>drush</code> wrapper file that the tutorials directed me to use when aliasing the Drush command.  As usually YMMV.</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>EDIT - September 8, 2010</p><p>I've been having issues with updating the Drupal core with Drush.  <code>drush up</code> works just fine to update any modules, but for some reason I get an error that Drush needs PHP 5.2 when trying to update the core.  It seems to kick out of php5 when it gets to Drupal core.  I've tried running the full <code>php5 /home/70298/users/.home/bin/drush/drush.php up</code> and it still says that my cli version of PHP is too old.  Any suggestions/workarounds/fixes are most welcome.  Thanks, JG.</p><p>EDIT - November 8, 2010</p><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;p&gt;After filing a ticket with Media Temple&apos;s Awesome Customer Support, they pointed me to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.mediatemple.net/w/GS:Allow_multiple_open_basedir_directories&quot;&gt;knowledge base article on configuring multiple open basedir directories&lt;/a&gt;.  I haven&apos;t had a chance to go through it yet and update the instructions above, but if and when this becomes absolutely necessary to use Drush, I certainly will.</pre>

		<p>Hello, faithful.  Or curious.  Or google searchers.  As usual I've got too many ideas and too much work and not enough time or attention span.</p><p>The iBD project <a href='http://github.com/JGrubb/ignored-by-dinosaurs'>lives here</a>, or rather is in gestation here.  It's probably going to be a few weeks at the least until i can actually put some time into it.  As I see it, there's a goodish amount of work to be done.  Gee, I wonder if that's why nobody has really tried this before?  Anyway, in the meantime I have some actual work that I need to get off of my plate and into my portfolio.  Being a relative Drupal newby presents many thrilling challenges.</p><p>The good news is that one of my current client projects involve calendaring, a big portion of the to-do list for this project.  Drupal already has most of this ground covered for us, but implementation is going to be key.  Adding an actual calendar does up the complexity, both for us as the builders and installers and for the end-client, the bands.</p><p>eCommerce is the big deal here, I think.  For too long it's been in the hands of someone else for most bands.  That's got to change.  If anyone knows more than I do about Amazon S3, please chime in.  I think DIY content distribution is going to be the paradigm of the near-future, and it's not that difficult for developers to do.  The challenge is to create a system that not to difficult for bands to do.  As always.  A system that monitors digital content downloads on the site and automatically throttles up cloud distribution as needed?</p><p>Anyway, just a quick "hi", and to let you know that I'm around if you need me.</p>

		<h2>The open source website system for musical artists</h2><p>It's so <em>obvious</em> when I say it out loud.  (edit: that's not exactly the most succinct tagline though, so help me out.)</p><p>If you're just joining the party and you don't know what open source is, <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2010/05/open-source-and-why-its-cool/'>check this out</a>.  If we haven't met before, this is <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/category/personal/'>some more of my backstory</a> over the last year or so.</p><h2>Pre-ramble</h2><p>Forgive me if you've read some of this here a hundred times.  Part of my process is to refine repeatedly.</p><p>I'm a musician.  I'm 32.  My entire professional career has been spent behind the wheel of either an upright bass, an electric bass, or a pair of turntables.  In particular the years from 2003 to 2009 were spent on the road with the band <a href='http://railroadearth.com/'>Railroad Earth</a>.  About 2 years ago I started teaching myself to program.  I wasn't really sure where I'd end up, but it seemed like a good skill to have for the inevitable day that I just couldn't keep touring for a living anymore.</p><!--break--><h2>Recent history</h2><p>I quit the band and started making a living as a web programmer.  I found a client who needed a me and have since been busy doing lots of nice stuff with a designer who I get along great with.  About a month ago I got another gig doing a little thing for this environmental non-prof out in San Francisco.  I built exactly the thing they asked me to in both <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href='http://drupal.org/'>Drupal</a>.  I built the Ruby version first with lots of help from a friend in about 5 days.  I spent 3 agonizing days trying to launch it on a shared webserver before giving up and rebuilding the entire thing in Drupal with 36 hours left until the deadline.  The Drupal version lit up the first time I flipped on the switch and <span class='highlight'>saved my bacon.</span>  I had already bought a ticket to DrupalCon - happening in San Francisco a few weeks after that.</p><h2>Drupal (droo'-pul)</h2><p>While at DrupalCon I drank lots and lots and <em>lots</em> of open source Kool-Aid.  The buzz that I got at DrupalCon was exactly like the buzz I used to get at music festivals we'd play every summer.  Tons of cool people hanging out, sharing ideas, drinking beer, meeting new cool people, and being excited about the same thing - the same cool, creative thing.  I went to sessions for geeks, for marketing folks, for freelancers, for non-profits, for you name it.</p><p>I came back a Drupal developer.</p><p>One of the cool tools that I was introduced to there was called <a href='http://openatrium.com/'>OpenAtrium</a>.  It's basically a tool for managing projects, a thing that becomes very necessary the instant you get off the road and start building websites.  I had tried out <a href='http://basecamphq.com/'>BaseCamp</a> with my new gig and liked it a lot.  OA was essentially an open source variation, built on top of Drupal.  Many of the contributions of the Drupal developer community were rolled into one comprehensive, focused package that was probably done in a fraction of the time that an enterprise team would taken to do a proprietary version of something similar.</p><p>Open source is a very powerful idea.  Drupal is free.  All the cool things that people have built to customize and extend Drupal are free.  That's why Open Atrium is free.</p><h2>The open source website system for musical artists</h2><p>So a cool feature of Drupal that's only recently getting attention paid to it is the "installation profile".  That's how OA works, and it basically means that you can set up Drupal how you want it (you can quite literally do almost anything that involves the internet with Drupal) and build a script that installs it that way anywhere.  You can have, for example, a <em>real</em> band website, for free, right out of the box.  The <a href='http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/blog'>blog</a>, the <a href='http://drupal.org/project/calendar'>tour dates</a>, the <a href='http://drupal.org/project/fbconnect'>Facebook</a> and <a href='http://drupal.org/project/flickr'>Flickr</a> integration, the <a href='http://drupal.org/project/advanced_forum'>forum</a>, the <a href='http://drupal.org/project/ubercart'>eCommerce</a> - virtually all of the pieces are <a href='http://drupal.org/project/Modules'>laying right there</a>, waiting to be assembled by those of us who know how.  Those of us who need something that doesn't exist yet write it and give it back to everyone else using the system.  It's constantly improved.  The roadmap for this thing could be ridiculously cool.  The <a href='http://drupal.org/project/Services'>API possibilities</a> if a bunch of people started using this thing?  Come on!</p><p>I know, the irony of this being a Wordpress powered site has occurred to me, but before I go and uproot and move this blog to Drupal so that we can get to collaborating for real, does this sound like a good idea?  One that could maybe change the game?</p><h2>Pssst, Drupal devs...</h2><p>I don't know if you've noticed, but the guys who made up OA and PressFlow and OpenPublish are making a damn decent business as consultants for their product.  I don't know if there's any money to be made here or not, but this market has been waiting for this idea.  Hell, <a href='http://groups.drupal.org/node/1041'>Drupal has been waiting for this idea</a>.  I know a <em>lot</em> of people in the music biz that would probably be delighted to help us out.  We can get press and we can get traction.  Anybody wanna help out?</p><p>Edit: <a href='http://acquia.com/blog/business-models-drupal-distributions'>the post that put the last piece of this idea into place</a>.  Thanks, Dries!</p>

		<blockquote>I realized about a year ago that nobody anywhere even had a clue, never mind a plan that saved what was worth saving about the music industry – the music part.</blockquote><p>=========</p><p>Guilty.  Most of us reading this are.  There were several entire generations that went by where it was a perfectly logical thing to associate money and music as somehow being comfortable companions if not downright synonymous.  It was BIG business - not in the way that defense contracting is, but it was perfectly logical for a certain subset of money and attention seeking individuals to get into the music business.  And you didn't even have to have musical talent!  In fact, there was more money in it for those who didn't!  Word eventually got around and by the late 80s most labels heads weren't music lovers but lawyers.  The snake started eating its tail sometime around then.  Nirvana was arguably the last great, game-changing band that came out of that entire era.</p><p>I don't <em>mean</em> to sound like one of those bloviating music biz pundits.  So anyway -></p><!--break--><p>I've held a simple and obvious belief for a few years now while transitioning from a musician into a programmer/musician.  If the internet tore down the old edifice, the internet will build the new one.  There are any number of eCommerce solutions out there for bands to <a href='http://www.cdbaby.com/'>sell their stuff</a> online.  There are any number of solutions out there to make <a href='http://bandzoogle.com/'>building your band's website</a> an easy and code-free endeavor.  There are any number of solutions out there to make it easier to <a href='http://www.artistdata.com/us/'>spread your word</a>.  These ideas are good ones, but still missing the target (in my humblest of opinions).  <span class='highlight'>The basic problem with all of these ideas is that they are still trying to monetize someone else's music.</span>  That scheme is the most fundamental cornerstone of the edifice that just fell.  Any successful new paradigm <em>must</em> throw it away.</p><p>Admittedly, it's the most difficult one to throw away.  However, imagine if a community emerged in pursuit of throwing this stone away. Not just a programmer or a company trying to reinvent the wheel and somehow still feed themselves, but an ecosystem of people who did it for the good of music itself in their free time, without the pressures of business and investors and expectations on them.</p><p>Sorta like an open source project, I guess...</p>

Therein lies the flaw.  That same flaw has reduced the record business into a heap of garbage-producing rubble.  That same flaw has lead to the consolidation of LiveNation and TicketMaster.  That same flaw keeps untold quantities of great music out of the ears of eager listeners every day because the avenues for promotion and distribution simply weren't available.</p><p>We can change that now.</p>

		<p>So, the software model of yore is just that.  The one where you go to the mall and buy a box with a disk inside of it.  Do you remember doing that?  I do.  I actually remember it more clearly than going to the music store, but that's probably a figment of where I'm at right now in terms of my interests.  I digress, within five sentences...</p><p>Where was I?  Oh yeah, so the music business of yore is just that.  Remember the one where you went to the store and bought a box with a disk in it?  That model isn't working out so well these days.  The problem is that it worked out SO well for SO long that the whole industry has taken an extraordinarily long time to figure out how to save their phony-baloney jobs.  I know - news flash, right?</p><p>Anyway, back to the software business, which is a lot younger as an industry and which has a pretty solid record of evolving past whatever Goliath emerges in whatever epoch/industry model is/was dominant.  Did that make sense?  What I meant was that the entire history of software is built by heretics who see the opportunity in moving the ball.</p><p>The music business, on the other hand, is historically run a little more like the country club.  It's mostly the same players that have been there, except for the few that have finally died and opened up a seat.  Even today.  You'd think that there'd be plenty of room for new upstarts with fresh ideas to come in and revolutionize an industry and an art form that is so clearly demanding just that.  Where's the evidence that that's the case?  I've got a funny story about the introduction of CD techology at an AES conference, but that's another post.</p><p>Pardon the long winded exposition.  I haven't been writing lately and it feels really good to have time.  I was on rt. 80 the other day and I had a flash.  What if you started a band and ran it like a software company?  Instead of "album cycles" you'd have "rapid development".  The product wouldn't just be music and the usual merch, but would really take advantage of technology to give the fan something more to interact with.  You'd have a rocking website of course, which would be the main avenue through which new creative product would be distributed.  You'd have a mobile app to give your fans commuting into NYC on the train something to play with/listen to on the way in.  The press would be so enamored with your savvy that you'd barely even need a publicist.</p><p>I think ideally you'd have a couple of developers who play in the band, a really strong songwriter, and a producer type.  Everyone gets to concentrate on their creative thing and everyone is fairly equal.  How fun would that be?</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/05/open-sourcing-the-idea" title="Permalink">Open sourcing the idea.</a></h2>
		<p>So, the 14 of you that still swing by here know my backstory.  Sometime in 2003 I joined a band with a neglected website.  At one of my first band meetings we discussed overhauling said website, since the majority of our fanbase was a grassroots kinda thing and most of our promotion happened via online channels like the <a href='http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=collection:RailroadEarth'>Archive</a> and <a href='http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/earthboard/'>YahooGroups</a>, etc.  Sometime in 2005 we still had that same website.  I was at my parent's house in north Georgia when it occurred to me "hey, you know, you could probably learn how to build websites in the time that it's going to take this band to get it together enough to hire someone to do it."  If I'd only listened to that voice more clearly, but instead I got bogged down on the Dreamweaver section of the Adobe site and gave up without really exploring what web development was all about.  I was still trying to be a musician in any case.</p><p>Fastforward to 2008 and we'd finally done something about our website a few months prior.  I got an iPhone.  I'll skip this part of the story since <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/category/iphone/'>it's been documented ad nauseum on this blog</a>.  Anyway, it didn't take long for the potential of mobile apps as a huge and brand-spanking-new market to become an obsession.  In particular - the potential for such apps to help revitalize a music business that had become very long on the latter and very short on the former.  There's also the simple fact that in 50 years people are going to be on these little things and not big old screens anymore and therefore the internet is at the very least going to need to be reformatted.  So, start learning to program iPhone apps...</p><p>Hey, this is hard to do yourself and really expensive if you hire someone.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could make a reusable framework for all your friends' bands so that y'all could share the cost and the rewards of such a system?  Well, if you're all sharing a mobile platform, you might as well be sharing a website platform too, since most of the stuff that's gonna be on that mobile app is going to have to live somewhere on the internet.  It'd be a lot easier to just interact with one protocol than a million, right?  If I'm not making sense, let me know.</p><p>Well, hey if we got everyone on the same platform for their website, then we could also build in lots of features that would make those sites more interactive with the rest of the internet as a whole.  I mean, who likes posting your tour dates to your own website and then to Facebook and then to MySpace (or <a href='http://www.artistdata.com/us/'>paying someone to do that for you</a>)?  Raise your hand if you know <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/04/chapter-4-api/'>what an API is</a>, and why it's important.  Wow, it seems like 10 years ago that I wrote that.</p><p>This was my thought process two years ago.  I'll be back.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/05/open-source-and-why-its-cool" title="Permalink">Open source and why it's cool</a></h2>
		<p>What is open source?  It can actually mean a variety of different things, but most simply it means free software that anyone can use as is or alter as they see fit for their particular needs.  According to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>Wikipedia</a> - "Some consider open source a philosophy, others consider it a pragmatic methodology."  I think I fall into both camps, but being the pragmatic, methodological guy that I am I shall present that angle today.</p><p>When I first got into software and development a few years ago it was because of one of the most proprietary devices out there - the iPhone.  Proprietary is the exact opposite of open source.  It is not free.  You are not welcome to see the iPhone OS source code.  You are not welcome to use anything except for Apple's set of development tools to build iPhone applications.  You may only distribute those applications through the AppStore, of which Apple is the sole overseer.  I didn't consciously realize the implications of this stuff two years ago.  I just wanted to build a band app that all my friends could use and get rich.  So I bought a Mac and dove in.</p><p>Upon diving in, I realized many things.  One is that Apple and their set of development tools - called Xcode (X as is OS X, the Mac OS) - came with the most amazing set of documentation on virtually every aspect of developing software built right in.  My education began there.  Poring over the included documentation and learning how the iPhone OS and Object Oriented programming worked on a high level was the beginning of the path for me here.  Among other things I learned that the Mac OS (operating system) and by extention the iPhone OS were built upon an open source OS called Unix.  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix'>Unix has been around since the late 60s</a>, and was initially developed at Bell Labs.  Unix runs on the "command line", which is like way back in the floppy disk era when you used to have to type into DOS to get your computer to run programs.  Most professional developers I met at the DrupalCon a month ago seem to have a deep fear of the command line.  Luckily my early experience with Rails and Git got me over that fear before I learned that I should have one.</p><p>Anyway, there are many different versions of Unix out there, some open source (meaning open to anyone helping develop it) and some proprietary (meaning you have to pay a licensing fee to even use it).  Some hippies at UC Berkeley one day got tired of Ma Bell and her ridiculous licensing fees and decided to make their own variant called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_bsd'>Free BSD</a>.  To make a long story shorter, Steve Jobs and co. took Free BSD in the late 90s and made it the base of their new OS.  OS X, a really awesome, intuitive, stable operating system that only legally runs on Macintosh computers took an open source project as it's guts.  What the world knows as OS X is basically a really nicely designed wrapper over top of Free BSD.  If you're on a Mac and you go up to the Spotlight in the top right and type in "Terminal", you'll get the command line for your computer.  This is the real operating system you are speaking to underneath the glitsy OS X veneer.</p><p>So what's the point?  Who cares?  Steve Jobs ripped off a bunch of hippies and now he's a genius?  Well, yes, and here's why.</p><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>By contrast, Free BSD - though a newer OS than Windows even - comes from a pedigree of having been developed and refined for the last 40 years.  Open source means anyone with the mind to can contribute to the project with only their own needs and imaginations as their guide.  Ultimately what happens in a sucessful open source project is that a <em>community</em> of developers begins to coalesce.  Different perspectives, features, and methodologies are brought in from all over the world by developers trying to solve problems, not by the marketing department downstairs or your manager who has to make his boss happy with this one feature.  What would be a security hole to exploit is plainly visible for all to see and for all to immediately get on top of fixing for the good of everyone who uses that software.  If you need a feature that doesn't exist yet, you write it yourself and share with everyone in the community.  I liken this to participating in the <a href='http://www.slopgrass.com/photo.htm'>late night jam at Slopryland</a>.</p><p>That's probably enough for now.</p>

Note how much background information there is once you get into the Civi documentation about what CRM actually is, and how it might help your organization.  Notice how much of the beginning of the Sugar docs is devoted to installing the thing, which is helpful but come on.  There's an automated installer file.  It's pretty simple for a developer.</p><p>I can't help but think of projects like Sugar as somehow "faker" than projects like Civi just because the very essence of open source is to encourage audience participation, not to make it easier for a consultant market to emerge because I can't wade through your shitty documentation.</p><p>Getting off the soapbox now.</p>

		<p>So, you've spent the last few months teaching yourself Wordpress.  Good job.  There are lot of crappy websites out there, most of them built by some site-builder commodity crap-stuffer at GoDaddy or Network Solutions or some other budget host.  These are God-awful examples of poor web development practices.  They're ugly.  They don't render correctly in browsers.  Many are all but invisible to search engines, which begs the question - if a website fails to show up in the first couple of pages of Google, does it make a sound?</p><p>Wordpress is a wonderful tool to combat these evils.  It's easily editable.  It's easy to learn.  It's east to add features.  It's typically built using modern presentation techniques that actually DO show up in search engines.  The <a href='http://diythemes.com/'>Thesis theme</a> is a marvel of <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/05/seo-in-action/'>SEO</a> and will get your page - pretty much no matter what - up on to the first page of Google depending on what you're writing about.</p><p>Neither here nor there, because you already have an idea of most of this stuff.  You've been tinkering around with MAMP and wordpress on your computer and now you want to know how to get your creation up and visible to the world.  This is involves two simple steps, and rather than repeat them, I'll just link to the site where I learned how to do it.</p><a href='http://weeklywp.com/2009/06/move-wordpress-to-a-new-server/'>http://weeklywp.com/2009/06/move-wordpress-to-a-new-server/</a><p>Questions and requests for clarifications are most welcome.  The first big hint is on the front page of the MAMP welcome page.  PHPMyAdmin is a database tool for managing your database.  That's where you'll export the database that you've been using to develop locally and upload it to your webhost.  Follow the instructions in the tutorial.  Every webhost I've seen so far has PHPMyAdmin installed somewhere, but where they'v hidden it usually varies.  If you are installing this on a server that's owned by, say, the Stamford school system, you might need to talk to an IT admin to get it happening.</p>

		<p>Inaugurating a new "Geek" category for this post with the hope that I can prune back most of the current categories into Geek and Non-Geek.  Anyway =></p><p>You're probably on a Macintosh and noticed it hanging momentarily every ten seconds or so.  You probably recently downloaded Photoshop or Dreamweaver or some other Adobe product that made you download and install the Akamai download manager before it would let you download and install the Adobe product you wanted in the first place.  Being conscientious about organization and maintenance of the files in your computer you probably deleted the Akamai download manager after you used it.  You went on your merry way and are probably enjoying your Adobe product.  At some point you realized this really annoying hang that your computer has been doing.  You went to the Console app and saw a list of error messages a mile long about a call to some plist feature that OS X couldn't find.  You have glimpsed the trail of your enemy.  A brief Google search turned up a few dated clues.  You've found yourself here.  Welcome.  Let's kill that fucker, shall we?</p><p>Here's the error -</p><code>3/19/10 12:10:10 PM	com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[398] (com.akamai.client.plist[606]) Bug: launchd_core_logic.c:4103 (23932):13 <br />

Spotlight doesn't find anything for Akamai.  Spotlight doesn't find anything for <code>com.apple.launched.peruser</code>.  The trail is going cold.  This is why you hate "download managers".  Aren't you capable of managing your own downloads?  </p><p>Well, the sad news is that since you're a conscientious, but perhaps not completely and utterly thorough computer user, you didn't dive deep into the README that was provided in the Akamai folder.  There was actually some useful info buried in there.  Here's the fix.</p><p>First, you have to go back to Adobe and pick out any trial product to use (again).  This will cause the Akamai thing to be reinstalled on your system, which is all you're after.  It'll download that goofy Akamai thing again to a disk image which you then install.  It will then start downloading the Adobe whatever.  You can stop the download at that point.  Now open up the Terminal and paste this command -</p><code>/Applications/Akamai/admintool uninstall -force</code><p>This is the only proper way to uninstall that stupid thing that you didn't want on your computer in the first place and for which they don't even provide an uninstaller, just a little hint in a README buried in the Akamai folder.  Restart your computer and hope it forgets all about it.

		<p>Well, it has been quite some time, hasn't it?  So much has changed!  So much is still the same!  Where to begin?  I've once again written this post in my head so many times that I don't know where to start.  How about the first thing that jumps to mind?</p><p>Okay, the first thing that jumps to mind is that I just found a card in my backpack yesterday.  It was given to me on new years in Portland, the night of my last show with RRE.  I don't remember who gave it to me, which was probably their plan (or maybe I was just so out of it that I really don't remember).<a href='http://flickr.com/photos/63216345@N00/196862911' title='Portland Hock'><img src='/sites/default/files/images/196862911_76fdc2b72e_m.jpg' style='float: left; margin-right: 2em; margin-top: .5em;' /></a>  Anyway, later that night I was sitting in Mark-a-rita's hotel room and realized that I'd been carrying this card around in my pocket all night and maybe I should open it and see what it was.  It was from everyone in the room, which was basically a great number of my really close friends from the RRE experience.  As soon as I a saw all the signatures on it and a couple of the things that people had written I shoved it back in the envelope.  I heard somebody behind me say "Oh, did he just open it?"</p><p>I couldn't read it then because I was totally overwhelmed.  From the time that I announced that I was leaving the band to that night at the Aladdin I was completely flooded with so much emotion from so many people with whom I'd shared most of my adult life that I myself was emotionally paralyzed.  It was amazing, and amazingly difficult.  Most Sundays after gig weekends during that period I would spend at least a little while crying and not knowing why.  I was leaving of my own free will and for reasons that were plenty good enough for me.  What was this all about?</p><p>By the time I got to Portland I couldn't take it anymore.  I'd had enough of people being so nice to me.  I didn't deserve it.  People gave me cards with hundreds of signatures on them telling me that I'd be missed.  Someone organized a can drive in my name at our Thanksgiving show, for Pete's sake.  What did I do?  I just played the bass!  I'd have been doing it anyway, hopefully, and instead I got to make friends and play shows and get good at the bass and be a rockstar for years.  I didn't deserve this outpouring.</p><p>So, to anyone reading this who was around in that period, this one's for you.</p><p>I know I'll see some of you again, but I'll never see all of you again.  My life has been a blessing, a dream.  When I can transcend my neurosis and the chaos of my life currently for a few brief moments and really just take a breath, I feel so profoundly grateful for being a part of it.  You and I made it together, and it was so. much. FUN!  I kind of get it now, some of what there was to be sad about.  Change is usually a wonderful thing, a necessary thing, but in a sense I feel like I've quit my family.  Like I've spit in the face of the thing that we built.  For that I'm both sorry and thankful for having had the experience in the first place.</p><p>I guess that'll do for now.  Hopefully this gets the writer's clog out.  I love you guys.</p>

It's ok to do less, skip details, and take shortcuts in your process if it'll lead to running software faster. Once you're there, you'll be rewarded with a significantly more accurate perspective on how to proceed. Stories, wireframes, even html mockups, are just approximations. Running software is real.

With real, running software everyone gets closer to true understanding and agreement. You avoid heated arguments over sketches and paragraphs that wind up turning out not to matter anyway. You realize that parts you thought were trivial are actually quite crucial.

Real things lead to real reactions. And that's how you get to the truth.

		<p>So, you've gone and installed MAMP and WordPress on your computer, or if you wanna sound really hip you call it your "local machine".  You've gone and started building out a wordpress site for your school because your current website is an outdated embarrassment.  Wordpress is kind of the no brainer choice, or so your buddy told you, because it's super easy for anyone to use who's familiar with a word processor.  You'd like to attempt to keep the content on your site fresh, so it sounds good to you.  Then you have a meeting with your principle and your so-called webmaster to talk about getting some of the things you've done put up and made available to the world.  Then they drop a little piece of info on you.</p><p>Your school's webhost doesn't do PHP, and they don't know if the district will let you move to another host.  Let me tell you what this seemingly innocuous piece of information means.</p><p>It's means you're screwed.</p><p>PHP is a programming language.  It's what's formally known as a scripted language.  <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/chapter1b/'>I have a post here</a> that explains what that means.  Wordpress is written in PHP.  The advantages of a scripted language are what lead them to be used to write the majority of cool, interactive websites in the world.  If you wanna sound hip you call them "web apps", since that's what they are.  Site kind of implies a place, a static location that will be there when you come back and won't have changed much.  An application is something you interact with.  It does things for you, like letting you write news for the frontpage of your school's website that it will then display to the world without your having to go in and code HTML.  Applications run on computers, or servers if they are web applications.</p><p>Compiled applications (the other kind besides scripted) have already been digested into machine code, which is to say 1s and 0s, prior to being run.  This means that they are essentially frozen and you can't alter anything about the source code without going through a rigamarole.  Scripted languages, in contrast, can be altered on the fly to add new features or fix bugs without having to be recompiled into machine code.  This makes scripted languages perfect for constantly evolving web apps.  The source code is right there on your webserver, and you can go and make changes to it.  The downside is that you have to have some special programmatic gear installed on your server.</p><p>Scripted languages have to have their respective libraries of code installed in order to for them to be "interpreted" at "runtime".  This whole long explanation is to tell you that since your webhost doesn't appear to have the appropriate libraries installed, your WordPress application is going to look like a bunch of gibberish to your webserver.  You can upload it, but as soon as you point a browser at the index.php file, the server is going to throw a "what the fuck is this?", also called an error.  That's why you had to install MAMP on your computer in the first place, remember?  And unfortunately, installing PHP isn't an easy process, especially for someone who almost certainly doesn't have the proper "permissions" allotted to them in the operating system of the webserver.</p><p>I realize there's a bunch of gobbledeegook in here.  I'll try to un-muddy the waters a bit in subsequent posts.  Specific questions are most welcome.  I should clarify that any webhosting company in the world is going to have PHP, and most likely a raft of other languages installed so that they can accommodate all types of clients and their disparately coded applications.  That your school's webhost doesn't have PHP - the most widely used web programming language in the world for the last decade or so running - tells me that your district has their own hilariously outdated webservers set up in the furnace room of some office somewhere.  We may be dead in the water, Jimmy...</p>

		<h2><a href="/2010/01/the-newby-web-programmer-episode-1" title="Permalink">The newby web programmer.  Episode 1.</a></h2>
		<p>This post is for my buddy Jimmy. He&#8217;s a teacher in CT and has set up a Wordpress.com site for his classroom. Of course the parents love it, and he&#8217;s the young techno-hip teacher in the school so his principal has allowed him to go and set up a new site for his school, whose hideous and outdated site was left for dead by the side of the road several years ago, apparently. He just sent me an email asking about downloading Wordpress. I responded by asking why because downloading and using Wordpress isn&#8217;t the piece of cake that you might think it is if you&#8217;ve never dealt with web servers and databases before. So I decided to make this public so that he and I and we may refer to it from now on. Besides, this hasn&#8217;t been blogged about nearly enough&#8230;</p>

<p>When I first downloaded Ruby on Rails I was a bit perplexed. It came with a README that gave these installation instructions that made no sense to me at all. I didn&#8217;t know anything about webservers at the time, or for a few months afterward, so here&#8217;s what I learned. This applies to Wordpress as well.</p>

<p>Wordpress and Ruby on Rails are both (more or less) database-backed content management systems. (If you know anything about Rails, you go right ahead and light my comments section up.) Drupal is, too. This means that the post that you&#8217;re reading right now isn&#8217;t stored as a word document or a text file on a file system as you know it on your computer. It&#8217;s stored as plain text in a database. Search the term here for a brief newby explanation from my ongoing programmer journal/book. What this means is that you have to hook wordpress up to a database server to have your content served. You also need to hook it up to a webserver to have your content served to and from a browser. This sounds complicated because it kind of is until you do it once or twice.</p>

<p>If you are a Mac user go Google MAMP, and download it. the AMP part of MAMP stand for Apache -the webserver, MySQL - the database, and PHP - the coding language that Wordpress is written in. Pardon my grammar. Install it. Now you have a webserver and a database server on your computer, so you can play with Wordpress now. In the MAMP directory somewhere is a folder called htDocs, which is the root of your webserver.</p>

<p>If you make a subdirectory under htdocs called Wordpress, unzip and copy all the files from a Wordpress download, and start MAMP, you can then point your browser to http://localhost:8888/Wordpress and install wordpress in a way that you can then use. You also need to create a database. Use the PHPMyAdmin feature of MAMP for this. Just figure it out. You won&#8217;t break anything. Create a database and give WordPress the name of that database. you&#8217;re good to go with Wordpress on your &#8220;local machine&#8221;.</p>

<p>More to come.</p>

		<p>So far it&#8217;s been a little boring. I&#8217;ve added a few modules, mostly to achieve some comment functionality that Wordpress comes with almost out of the box, and somehow I find my database up to 90+ tables. And the comments don&#8217;t even really work that well.</p>

<p>So, in researching how to move from Drupal to Wordpress (since I&#8217;ve of course been doing mountains of Wordpress hacking for the last weeks since moving to Drupal), I&#8217;ve discovered that it&#8217;s basically not easily doable, due to the above mentioned database bloat and variety of setups. Thus&#8230;</p>

<p>Version 4.0 shall be a Rails app. I&#8217;ve said this before, but I&#8217;m going to have to manually import all of my old posts and comments shit like that in via SQL most likely. To the layman this means a lot of interesting and educational work. I&#8217;ll bet I can copy what I need for a functional blog in </p>

<p>And, in my humble opinion, he&#8217;s begging the FTC and the FCC to get involved in a sector of the economy in which they can only do lasting and permanent harm. This is why 25 year olds shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to be CEO of companies this large. This is nothing more or less than youthful hubris and this giant mis-step is the first on the road to irrelevance. I hope for the sake of Silicon Valley that they don&#8217;t IPO now, because they&#8217;re done. It&#8217;ll take a few years, but they&#8217;re done&#8230;</p>

		<p>I appreciate that you&#8217;ve stopped by. I unfortunately have nothing to say about anything. I feel like I should be giving some sort of summation on the last 7 years in a band, but I don&#8217;t have anywhere near the perspective to do so yet. I also don&#8217;t feel like just blathering about technology (again) yet, as I don&#8217;t feel like I have the guns to be espousing my viewpoints on that either.</p>

<p>This blog might be a little static for a little while.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m doing in the meantime is rewriting JohnnyGrubb.com as a Rails app. This will be my first Rails app from scratch. The Posts model (system) is pretty much done, and I, and only I, can blog away all I want. The trick is the comments model. I&#8217;ve got a commenting system in place, but what it needs is the simple little email verification and website linking tricks that all blogs have. I&#8217;ve got the database set up to receive the info, and display the info, but verifying that email addresses are in the correct format and setting the commenter&#8217;s name to link to their website, if they put that in, is a bit more of a trick. when I get it figured out, you&#8217;ll know. <!--break--></p>

		<blockquote>"A systemic failure has occurred, and I consider that totally unacceptable," an angry and unusually blunt Obama told reporters near his vacation retreat in Hawaii.</blockquote><em><a href='http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-terror-obama30-2009dec30,0,887782,full.story'>via LA Times</a></em>
<p>A few points =&gt;</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t noticed any change in any security whatsoever in any of the 3 airports in which I&#8217;ve been in the last three days. I am not, nor has anyone that I&#8217;ve talked to been concerned with getting killed by a terrorist. The perp in the case was &#8220;subdued by passengers and crew&#8221; on the plane.</p>

<p>Flying is miserable. It has been for years by now. The entire process from finding a ride to the airport to getting picked up and certainly everything in between seems as if scientifically designed to exert as much stress on as large a segment of the population as possible. Atlanta&#8217;s airport sees almost &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#8221;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartsfield–Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport&#8221;&gt;a million flights&lt;/em&gt; a year&lt;/a&gt;. Belligerence is high.</p>

<p>The &#8220;threat level&#8221; was already at orange, and probably has been for several months. It was not raised after the attempted attack. This got me to thinking.</p>

<p>Has the Bush/Cheney threat level mechanism actually desensitized us to the possibility of a terrorist threat so thoroughly by this point that even when there is an attack nobody really cares? And if the ultimate goal of the terrorist is to make us afraid, and we&#8217;re not really that afraid, have we now won the war on terror? None of the security measures in place stopped this asshole, a fellow passenger did. I&#8217;m surprised they didn&#8217;t beat him to a pulp, for if someone were attempting to blow me up on a plane on Christmas day, that&#8217;s quite likely what I&#8217;d be inclined to do. And how much further past the point of diminishing returns are we going to push this quest for airline security? Wouldn&#8217;t we be safer giving all passengers a set of brass knuckles before they board the plane?</p>

		<p>I just realized this weekend that I missed something in Friday&#8217;s post.<br /><ul>
<li><a href='http://www.jambase.com/Articles/9417/BILL-NERSHI-LEAVING-SCI'>Nershi's announcement</a>.</li>

<li><a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/11/and-i-bid-you-goodnight'>And mine</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So, if you haven&#8217;t already, take a look at the dates, and allow me to prepare a meditation on why November seems to be such a drag for touring bands&#8230; <!--break--> Surprise! I&#8217;m a cliche! All of these announcements were dated sometime in November - Billy in &#8216;06, Ben in &#8216;07, Zac in &#8216;08, and myself in &#8216;09. I already asked, what is it about November that makes one of us flip out and quit our band each year? Well, obviously, all of these bands are summertime festival circuit bands. That was RRE&#8217;s bread and butter, sort of like the hippy band equivalent of Black Friday. Remaining closed on Black Friday is not an option for most retail businesses, just as not hitting the road each summer is not an option for a band that also wishes to remain a viable business. So, how does that end up laying out your touring year? We&#8217;ll start in the spring&#8230;</p>

<p>Spring tour is great. People have been bottled up all winter and are ready to party. You&#8217;ve had all winter to get creative (or not) and hopefully have a boatload of new tunes ready for your crowd. These are all club dates since festival season hasn&#8217;t begun yet, and usually they are packed with a fired up crowd. You deliver. Your job is the best one on earth. March, April, May.</p>

<p>Festival Season! It usually starts some time in April for most of us, though if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be on the <a href='http://magmusic.com/'>Judy's fav list you might get to start early at SpringFest</a>. The majority of your summer is spent doing what&#8217;s called &#8220;routing&#8221;, which means getting from good gig to good gig. Hopefully, those good gigs are every weekend and Tuesday night is paying for the gas between Fridays, but if not, and your next gig is on an opposite coast, then you might be playing some of the dreaded &#8220;routing dates&#8221;. These are the gigs in Winters, CA on the Wednesday before High Sierra Music Festival, or the Bottleneck in Lawrence, KS before or after Wakarusa. They&#8217;re rough, not only because you get yanked from festival land back to club reality, but because the vast majority of the live band audience isn&#8217;t really interested in going to the Bottleneck in the middle of summer. Club owners don&#8217;t have the option of shutting their club for the whole summer, and some scenes probably do a really good business in clubs in the summer, but ours ain&#8217;t one of them. File under : necessary evil. It&#8217;s cool, though. On weekends you&#8217;re a rockstar.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s fall. You&#8217;ve already been on the road for half the year. September might throw you a festival bone or two, but mostly it&#8217;s back to the clubs. The edge has come off of what were fresh tunes and a fired up crowd. It&#8217;s time to start laying out plans for the winter. You need to write a new record, but you also need to keep the business going, so it&#8217;s a constant push and pull. Oh, you&#8217;re on the road while you&#8217;re deciding all of this so usually you&#8217;re too tired to really be able to puzzle out the correct combination of dates that will keep the business far enough above water to enable you to do what you really want to do, and that&#8217;s be home with your family and write some new music. Your crowd will be there, and they will be expecting you to prove your otherworldly talent by delivering them fresh new tunes, preferably originals but whatever they want at the time will be fine. Do not disappoint, my friends.</p>

<p>So you walk the line, and don&#8217;t line up a winters full of shows so that you can get creative. The problem? You&#8217;ve been on the road for so long by this point in the year that you don&#8217;t remember how to write music. Better line up some shows for February, since payroll is running out&#8230;</p>

<p>Wash, rinse, repeat for at least 7 years and what you have is a subconscious dread of winter.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/12/record-labels" title="Permalink">On record labels.</a></h2>
		<p>I was just thinking this morning about what a hilarious and glaring anachronism the term &#8220;record label&#8221; actually is. The &#8220;record&#8221; as a popular medium for musical commerce was essentially replaced by the CD when I was about 5 years old. There haven&#8217;t been &#8220;labels&#8221; on popularly consumed music nor have they been sold in &#8220;record&#8221; form in approximately 25 years. Yet mavins of popular culture wonder &#8220;what will become of the record label system?&#8221; When will they finally embrace the digital model (or <em>a</em> digital model)? Will they just continue to sue copyright infringers until it&#8217;s no longer profitable to do so? How long has it honestly been since record labels even bothered with the pretense of being purveyors of culture, anyway?</p>

<p>A buddy of mine forwarded me a link to a <a href='http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2009/12/music-as-commerce-understanding-a-mindset.html'>nicely written piece</a> on the stages of music business decline that we&#8217;ve all witnessed over the last ten years. Recommended reading.</p>

<p>So, let&#8217;s remove the rose colored glasses that I had on for the trip down memory lane that was <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/recordingtechnology'>my post on the valuable service that record labels once provided to American culture</a>. Let&#8217;s talk about the flipside of the equation. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, and is something I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to sooner. There are many reasons I&#8217;m leaving RRE at this time. The fact that of the impending record contract which would obligate me for the next several years is only part of the story from my end. One of the other parts is that I&#8217;d feel kind of like a D-bag for signing a record label contract on the one hand while doing everything in my power to kick the legs out from under the entire faltering system on the other. Make no mistake about it - I think that the record label system and most of the folks who have made a living in the record business for the last 50 years deserve everything that they are reaping right now. They used to provide a service over which they had a monopoly - the recording and distribution of recorded works. There was no practical way around the fact of recording and distribution for an artist in the age when physical media were the only media.</p>

<p>This monopoly was supported on all sides by a conglomeration of other media companies - print publications, radio stations, television studios - whose sole purpose was to make and promote product that made money for all. The cultural side effects were a bonus as far as shareholders was concerned (if they were concerned at all). However, all of these media outlets now find themselves in the exact same position of irrelevance. The tremendous and spectacular downfall of the recording industry was only a prelude to what&#8217;s to come for all the rest of these companies - witness the Boston Globe, or NBC, or any of the awful top 40 Clear Channel radio stations out there whose ad revenues are dwindling in the face of the coming storm. Don&#8217;t even get me started on TicketBastard and their &#8220;convenience&#8221; charge. Go ahead and merge with LiveNation, you&#8217;re only hastening and enlarging your own downfall. It will come.</p>

<p>For the last ten years there&#8217;s been no practical justification for that model to remain in existence save for the folks in charge are familiar with it, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s always been, and that&#8217;s how it is. They will all be dead soon enough, though. Our musical and cultural heritage will not, however. So it is up to us to figure out the path toward self-sufficiency in the cultural arts. Here&#8217;s my high-falutin&#8217; theory -&gt;</p>

<p>If what burned the old way to the ground was 1s and 0s, then what shall rise from the ashes and light the way forward for us all shall also be 1s and 0s. This obviously means the internet. Where other efforts to cram the old model into the new era have failed, ours shall succeed. Where the old models existed for the enrichment of a very few in the business, the new model shall succeed in creating a sustainable livelihood for those of us who create art, who create cultural value, and who share our artistic wealth in the interest of enriching the lives of others as well as ourselves.</p>

<p>Record labels and middlemen of all stripes be warned. <em>I'm coming for you</em>.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/12/dear-wood-brothers" title="Permalink">Dear Wood Brothers,</a></h2>
		<p>We met last October at the taping of the &#8221;<a href='http://www.woodsongs.com/showdetailspage.asp?SN=505'>Woodsongs Radio Hour</a>&#8221; in Louisville, Kentucky. It was the one where Edgar Meyer and Chris Thile were there, also. They did the show after ours? Anyway, I just wanted to tell you something&#8230;</p>

<p>I spent the better part of my college years listening to a lot of MMW. I actually had to willfully cut myself off because I was absorbing a bit too much of Chris&#8217; style, in my youthful opinion. I hadn&#8217;t really listened to much in the several years since then, but it was still a bit of an intimidating treat to be on the set of this nationally syndicated radio show with Chris Wood and Edgar Meyer. My bass teacher in college used to drag us to master classes down in Hickory NC, and Edgar&#8217;s was one of them. It was mindblowing, but I digress. I went out and bought your album, <em><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Loaded-Wood-Brothers/dp/B00140GXSI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1260651688&sr=1-1'>Loaded</a></em>, the day after the taping.</p>

<p>The point I&#8217;m getting at is that we, as professional musicians, have been taught through many generations of unfortunate Pavlovian training to view the worth of our art through the lens of commerce. How many units we sell is how good our record is. Of course, we know that we&#8217;re creating art and that the value of our work can&#8217;t be quantified as simply and as greedily as that, but if your record doesn&#8217;t move that many units, it&#8217;s harder to stay excited about it as a work of art, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s certainly harder to keep our record label excited about it. That fact is quite likely the fundamental cause of the mess that we find our &#8220;industry&#8221; in, wouldn&#8217;t you say? That it&#8217;s an industry at all is part of the problem. Irony.</p>

<p>So, I just wanted to take a moment to tell you, in public, what a profoundly great record it is. It&#8217;s moved me to tears more times than I can count, and almost every song on there has at one point or another perfectly summed it all up for me. I haven&#8217;t heard music as good since probably the first time I ever heard Gillian Welch. I&#8217;m not sure how many units it&#8217;s sold, maybe &#8220;not many&#8221;, but it&#8217;s one of the finest albums I&#8217;ve ever heard. So, thank you.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/12/quitting-band" title="Permalink">On quitting a band.</a></h2>
		<p>I thought I&#8217;d take this quiet opportunity to try and recall some of the thoughts that have been bouncing around my head the last few weeks. I was thinking about all the various manners in which many of the bands that I&#8217;ve known have experienced or dealt with personnel changes. I believe there to be a spectrum, and my departure from RRE seems to fall somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>On the one side you have the &#8220;okay, bye&#8221; method, most notably employed by my friend <a href='http://www.hotbutteredrum.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2572&Itemid=174'>Zac Matthews</a>, formerly of Hot Buttered Rum. (Funny, his was a November announcement as well. What is it about impending winter that runs roughshod over summertime festival bands? Rhetorical question.) Obviously this approach has it&#8217;s pros and cons. The most obvious con is the sense of a lack of closure that the public can feel when one day everything is cool and the next their favorite band is no longer what it was. I know I felt something of a shock when <a href='http://www.tealeafgreen.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=15721'>Ben quit Tea Leaf</a> or when John-O split SCI. You want to know &#8220;why?&#8221; Usually you are disappointed. The pro (singular) of doing it like this would presumably be that relations within the band have deteriorated to such a degree by this point that dragging it out over a farewell tour would not be a good thing at all for anyone. I&#8217;m glad that&#8217;s not the case here.</p>

<p>Then there&#8217;s the other end of the spectrum, most notably employed by <a href='http://www.jambase.com/Articles/9417/BILL-NERSHI-LEAVING-SCI'>Bill Nershi</a> of String Cheese Incident. I&#8217;m not going to rehash the reasons for his splitting, mostly because I&#8217;m afraid he might be reading this. Instead, I&#8217;m going to guess at them. Bill was the frontman of a huge operation. They weren&#8217;t just a band at the point when he had to call it, and hadn&#8217;t been for many years. As much as I look up to their operation, and the operation of Phish or even Umphrey&#8217;s McGee as a band whose business model seems sound from my perspective, I can understand the pressure of finding yourself in that position of success. Let&#8217;s face it, most musicians don&#8217;t become musicians because they like running companies, yet the more successful your band becomes the more of your time the business syphons off. The less time you have to make music. The less time you have to contemplate taking a break since the rest of the operation doesn&#8217;t go on holiday just because you do. I think this played a big part in Phish&#8217;s hiatus, aside from the much publicized substance issues. The business of being in a band can be a major grind. I digress&#8230;</p>

<p>This approach also has it&#8217;s pros and it&#8217;s cons. The most notable pro is that you can actually set it up in a very lucrative business-like manner for your last tour to be a &#8220;farewell&#8221; one. I&#8217;m not sure how much $ SCI made on that summer 07 tour, but they didn&#8217;t play another gig until summer 09, so it must&#8217;ve been okay. The fans of the band get to relish a last hoorah, and the band members themselves get to say goodbye to a lifestyle as well as some of the locales that have become home out there, if only for a little while. The cons of this approach are relatively minor, mostly having to do with people continually asking &#8220;so what are you gonna be doing next?&#8221; It&#8217;s a natural question, but you might not always have an answer ready.</p>

<p>Where I fall is somewhere in between. I wouldn&#8217;t quit this band if I were less than ready. As I may have said to some of you, this decision took me years to come to, but on the other hand I&#8217;ve known for years that it was coming. Sometimes when I walk into a room full of hobos I get this feeling like everyone is looking at me, like I&#8217;m a dead man walking. And to be perfectly honest, I haven&#8217;t had a ready made answer for what kind of music my band plays for the last seven years, so obviously I don&#8217;t have a ready made answer to &#8220;what are you doing next?&#8221; Well, I&#8217;m gonna be programming. You see this website? I&#8217;m gonna make a living off of it one day.</p>

<p>The pros - I get to say goodbye.</p>

<p>The cons - sometimes I&#8217;m tired of saying goodbye.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/12/todays-discoveries" title="Permalink">Today's discoveries</a></h2>
		<!--break-->
<p>I had a great blog post going in my head while I was cooking dinner, and now that I have time to write it all down, I&#8217;m too tired. It&#8217;s been a long day. We woke up without power this morning, which happens way too often in Stillwater. No power means no heat and no water, since we&#8217;re on a well and our pump is probably as old as I am. So I got out of bed, lit a fire in the fireplace, lit the burner on the stove and got to making pancakes. We were out most of the day, hence my tiredness. Made an awesome black bean soup for dinner. Not your typical black bean, but more of a Cuban influenced recipe that calls for a couple of tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. It&#8217;s awesome. Maybe I&#8217;ll start a recipes section on this site, which will be fully searchable as soon as I figure out Apache SOLR&#8230;</p>

<p>So anyway, today&#8217;s tech discoveries. First of all, Google Chrome for Mac was finally released yesterday. It&#8217;s not bad. The thing with browsers now is that there is NO user loyalty, at least not with me. Think back to the good old days when you didn&#8217;t know there was a thing such as a browser. IE <em>was</em> the internet. I felt like I was cheating the day I went and downloaded Firefox, even though I was telling myself that I was merely subverting the paradigm or something like that. I stuck with FF for a few years, for at least a month into my Mac-hood. Then one day a weird thing happened (I don&#8217;t remember what), and the advice I got was to try a different browser. Opera was the one that was advised to make this broken site work, but Camino was the one that I was told was &#8220;generally the best Mac browser&#8221;. So within a month I&#8217;d skipped out on MS completely, and had gone and stabbed my open source friends at Mozilla square in the back. I mean, sure, Camino is a Mozilla product, but I&#8217;m sure they knew where this was headed. Safari 4. JavaScript rendering so fast that it makes you actually say &#8220;wow&#8221;. And when your main email client is GMail, which is nothing but a mountain of JS (or AJAX if you wanna get particular), you start to notice such things. That was only 6 months ago or so. Now I&#8217;m typing this post up in Chrome. God knows where this ends. I&#8217;ll probably join some open source project one of these days.</p>

<p>Discovery #2. JQuery Lightbox. I can already tell that it&#8217;s going to be derided as overused, but DAMN it&#8217;s sweet. Click on my &#8220;Contact&#8221; menu link up there. That superfly effect that superimposes the form over the screen? Seems kinda familiar, right? That&#8217;s JQuery in action. Sweet.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, or sometime this weekend, I promise you a post on quitting a band, and the many ways in which it can go down as well as a state of my noggin report.</p>

<p>thanks, all&#8230;</p>

I've felt something of a mental block since I made my pronouncement on the purpose of this blog.  I didn't really feel like talking about what a wreck I was after the last CO show, or how Vince Guaraldi set me off Sunday afternoon after Stroudsburg.  It's my bidness, and there's not really much to say about it.  So, I'm just going to resume writing about whatever...</p>

		<p>I had so much fun last night that I'm writing about it before I've even had a cup of coffee.</p><p>The first rule of Geek Club is:</p><p>Don't talk about Geek Club.  Actually this first rule is my own, and I'm breaking it immediately, except that I shall not refer to Geek Club by it's true name.  It took me many months of searching to find it, and I don't want to spoil the sense of victory for you, should you be inclined to sniff out your own local chapter.</p><p>The second rule of Geek Club is:</p><p>Be prepared to practice your pitch.  That's what pretty much everybody is here for, and some of them may even try to poke holes in your idea.  Sooo much fun...</p><p>The third rule of Geek Club is:</p><p>There are no NDAs.  Presumably, everybody here has an idea that they're working on, so they don't really have time to steal your idea.  That and the ideas and interests and fields that people are working in and on are sooo widely varied.  I met a dude working on a project involving credit cards, a dude working on a project involving medical testing, a dude who cofounded a startup called <a href='http://www.seatgeek.com/'>SeatGeek</a>, and a dude who wants to help you find <a href='http://whatisfresh.com/'>fresh local food in NYC</a>.  Yes, Geek Club is a primarily, though not exclusively, male environment.</p><p>The fourth rule of Geek Club is:</p><p>Tolkien references are okay.  I had this image flash in my head toward the end of the meeting of storming the gates of some castle, that castle presumably being the tech scene that I'm busting into now.  So you know that scene at the end of <em>The Two Towers</em> where the humans are holed up in Helms Deep with the orc hoard at the gates?  As my brain was almost to sleep, I figured that actually, that fortress is the music business of old, and that mongrel hoard is me and my musician buddies.  And this idea that I'm working on is the big scary orc with the bomb that blows the joint to hell.  And the mongrel hoard is going to win this time, come hell or high water.</p><p>SO EXCITED!</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/11/creative-fire" title="Permalink">The creative fire</a></h2>
		<p>I just finished "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" in the ATL airport yesterday.  I tried to read it in college and failed miserably - it was just way too wordy and too deep for 20 year old me.  For some reason about a month and a half ago I picked it back up and gave it another try, shortly before I started coming to grips with the fact that my spell in RRE is drawing to a close.  It's basically the tale of a man and his son on a road trip.  The man has battled mental illness in the past, the memories which were erased by shock therapy.  The book is partly the tale of his putting his past back together again via a philosophical exploration while riding on a motorcycle (obviously) from Minnesota to San Francisco.</p><p>I got a lot out of this book this time.  Whether it's the station I'm at at this point in my life, whether it's the fact that I have Noah now, whether it's the fact that I'm just older now, I didn't have much trouble with the sections that gave me trouble 11 years ago.  On the contrary, there were several sections that could've been written about me.  There is one in particular where the narrator is recounting a portion of his past where he taught Rhetoric at the University of Montana in Missoula.  One semester he decides to conduct an experiment - to do away with grades for the whole semester.  The students will receive a grade at the end of the course, and not before.  The section that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up is toward the beginning of his recount of the experiment, when he's stating his hypothesis.  I'll quote it, rather than summarize.  Pardon the length.</p><blockquote><p>Phaedrus'  argument for the abolition of the degree and grading system produced a nonplussed or negative reaction in all but a few students at first, since it seemed, on first judgment, to destroy the whole University system.  One student laid it wide open when she said with complete candor, "Of course you can't eliminate the degree and grading system.  After all, that's what we're here for."</p>
<p>She spoke the complete truth.  The idea that the majority of students attend a university for an education independent of the degree and grades is a little hypocrisy everyone is happier not to expose.  Occasionally some students do arrive for an education but rote and the mechanical nature of the institution soon converts them to a less idealistic attitude.</p>
<p>The demonstrator was an argument that elimination of grades and degrees would destroy this hypocrisy.  Rather than deal with generalities it dealt with the specific career of an imaginary student who more or less typified what was found in the classroom, a student completely conditioned to work for a grade rather than the knowledge the grade was supposed to represent.</p>
<p>Such a student, the demonstrator hypothesized, would go to his first class, get his assignment and probably do it out of habit.  He might go to his second and third as well.  But eventually the novelty of the course would wear off and, because his academic life was not his only life, the pressure of other obligations or desires would create circumstances in where he just would not be able to get an assignment in.</p>
<p>Since there was no degree or grading system he would incur no penalty for this.  Subsequent lectures which presumed he'd completed the assignment might be a little more difficult to understand, however, and this difficulty, in turn, might weaken his interest to a point where the next assignment, which he would find quite hard, would also be dropped.  Again no penalty.</p>
<p>In time his weaker and weaker understanding of what the lectures were about would make it more and more difficult for him to pay attention in class.  Eventually he would see that he wasn't learning much; and facing the continual pressure of outside obligations, he would stop studying, feel guilty about this and stop attending class.  Again, no penalty would be attached.</p>
<p>But what had happened?  The student, with no hard feelings on anybody's part, would have flunked himself out.  Good!  This is what should have happened.  He wasn't there for a real education in the first place and he had no real business there at all.  A large amount of money and effort had been saved and there would be no stigma of failure and ruin to haunt him the rest of his life.  No bridges had been burned.</p>
<p>The student's biggest problem was a slave mentality which had been built into him by years of carrot-and-whip grading, a mule mentality which said, "If you won't whip me, I won't work."  He didn't get whipped.  He didn't work.  And the cart of civilization, which he supposedly was being trained to pull, was just going to have to creak along a little slower without him.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of civilization, "the system," is pulled by mules.  This is a common, vocational, "location" point of view, but it's not the Church attitude. [<em>not the church of the religious type, but I don't have time to explain all that here -jg</em>].</p>
<p>The Church attitude is that civilization, or "the system" or "society" or whatever you want to call it, is best served not by mules but by free men.  The purpose of abolishing grades and degrees is not to punish mules or get rid of them but to provide an environment in which that mule can turn into a free man.</p>
<p>The hypothetical student, still a mule, would drift around for a while.  He would get another kind of education quite as valuable as the one he'd abandoned, in what used to be called the "school of hard knocks."  Instead of wasting money and time as a high-status mule, he would now have to get a job as a low-status mule, maybe as a mechanic.  Actually his <em>real</em> status would go up.  He would be making a contribution for a change.  Maybe that's what he would do for the rest of his life.  Maybe he'd found his level.  But don't count on it.</p>
<p>In time - six months; five years, perhaps - a change could easily begin to take place.  He would become less and less satisfied with a kind of dumb, day-to-day shop-work.  His creative intelligence, stifled by too much theory and too many grades in college, would now become reawakened by the boredom of the shop.  Thousands of hours of frustrating mechanical problems would have made him more interested in machine design.  He would like to design machinery himself.  He'd think he could do a better job.  He would try modifying a few engines, meet with success, look for more success, but feel blocked because he didn't have the theoretical information.  He would discover that when before he felt stupid because of his lack of interest in theoretical information, he'd now find a brand of theoretical information which he'd have a lot of respect for, namely, mechanical engineering.</p>
<p>So he would come back to our degreeless and gradeless school, but with a difference.  He'd no longer be a grade-motivated person.  He'd be a knowledge motivated person.  He would need no external pushing to learn.  His push would come from inside.  He'd be a free man.  He wouldn't need a lot of discipline to shape him up.  In fact, if the instructors assigned him were slacking on the job he would be likely to shape <em>them</em> up by asking rude questions.  He'd be there to learn something, would be paying to learn something and they'd better come up with it.</p>
<p>Motivation of this sort, once it catches hold, is a ferocious force, and in the gradeless, degreeless institution where our student would find himself, he wouldn't stop with rote engineering information.  Physics and mathematics would come within his sphere of interest because he'd see he needed them.  Metallurgy and electrical engineering would come up for attention.  And, in the process of intellectual maturing that these abstract studies gave him, he would be likely to branch out into other theoretical areas that weren't directly related to machines but had become part of a larger goal.  This larger goal wouldn't be the imitation of an education in Universities today, glossed over and concealed by grades and degrees that gave the appearance of something happening when, in fact, almost nothing is going on.  It would be the real thing.</p></blockquote><p>The hair on my neck is still standing up.  I did poorly in school.  Don't know why, but I just hated it.  I and my parents were routinely told by teachers what potential I had that was going to waste.  It was humiliating.  My overarching, impressionistic memory of my academic career is that of a humiliated mule.  As I mentioned in my <a href='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/02/numero-uno/'>very first blog post</a>, I was kicked out of the band in 10th grade for not getting with the program.  And now I've been a professional musician for the last 12 years, virtually since I left high school.  I don't blame anyone for my stubborn refusal to do the rote bullshit work we were all assigned, but something was clearly not right.  I was a kid, for crying out loud.</p><p>Anyway, the great thing about college was that it enabled me to shed a lot of the self-esteem issues that I graduated high-school with.  It also more fully introduced me to a very deep and powerful talent that had always been there, waiting to be discovered and nutured.  Music.  Music has made me what I am.  But at the same time, I can't help but feel that I've been a mechanic for the last seven years.  That my real education, my real work, my real purpose begins now.</p>

		<p>Shouldn&#8217;t it be a little more like this -&gt;</p>
<blockquote><p>You're a new user to the iBD CMS.  The initial login screen is simple, clean.  It has 3 fields that you need to fill in to register - Your name, your password, and your band's name.  You press the <strong>submit</strong> button and that's it.  Your new website is active.  The second screen you come to asks for your Facebook login information.  You enter it, and since your an admin of your bands Facebook page, you just directly imported all the data that is present on your Facebook page - that's a bio, your tour dates, band members, any contact info, links to videos and photos, pretty much everything a website needs is automatically populated with the press of a button.</p>
  
<p>That's cool!  But wait, this bio is a little outdated. It still has the story about carving a path deep and wide.  Let's change this a little bit.  And once we're done, we press <strong>save</strong> and it's automatically sent to Facebook, since your  admin account is already linked.</p></blockquote><p>Are you starting to get the picture?</p>

		<p>The ongoing sorrow in my life is this -&gt;</p>
<h3>You can build an awesome website, and then where are you?</h3><p>The answer is that you're ahead of at least some of the craptastic pack.  The rest of the answer is that you've just taken a major step into proving that you take yourself seriously on the internet.  You have opened Pandora's box, my friend, and if you think you can shut it, the world will know just what a punk you are.  After all, the days when your website was the totality of your internet presence have faded into our collective long-term memories by this point.  I'm not gonna say "social networking is just as, if not more important" because that would be insulting your intelligence.  Besides, you already know how much more time you spend on Facebook than the best band website out there.</p><h3>So now I have to babysit this thing, too?</h3><p>And this is where the drudgery begins, my friends.  Take it from someone who valiantly attempted to up the ante on RRE's web presence -> <em>the internet is a big place</em>.  There are plenty of musicians out there that are intensely adept at using one or more facets of their web presence to the fullest effect, but it takes practice.  If you're on Twitter, would you do me a favor and follow the <a href='http://twitter.com/stringdusters'>@stringdusters</a>?  I'm not sure who does the posting for them, but I think it's the one Anders calls "Panda".  He gets it.  And he gets it more every day.  It's been something to behold over the past few months, and it makes me envious somewhere in my heart that I'm not as good a Twitterer as they.  But I also know that someone with a hammer that bangs Twitter nails probably isn't as sharp or as diligent about banging the Facebook nails, or the Tumblr nails, or hell, what's going on on their website?  </p><p>Are you with me so far?</p>

I was bummed out about RRE&apos;s website and the fact that it was just a little too static, a little too disconnected from the rest of the internet.  It was a custom built solution, and God bless you Berry for that, but I didn&apos;t even know what that meant at that time.

		<p>Lots of personal posts to come these next few weeks, I expect.  I wanted to take this opportunity during setbreak in Woodstock to set down a few things that I was thinking about during the first set.</p><p>I've gotten a few cautionary letters from concerned onlookers of my situation, most of them warning me of the pitfalls of this decision that I've made.  First, I want to let you know that I've been making the internal preparations for this move for well over a year.  It was about that long ago that the force inside me that's guided me very reliably through my first 31 years here on earth began to lead me to this public announcement of my decision.  Second, I want you to know that I've never ignored that force.  That force told me to print up business cards the week before I met John Skehan for the first time.  Third, I have no idea what I'd do without that force.  I might have had some crappy job that I hated for the last seven years instead of touring the world with a fantastic band.  Fourth, trading this interesting, creative job down for some cubicle job programming VB is not what I have in mind (no offense to VB).  I have a very specific, interesting, creative idea that I've been working on that I'm gonna have a whack at, but it's a long shot.  I have some other interesting, creative options on the table, and I feel hopeful that one of them will pan out.  Fifth, and this is probably going to be the most difficult for some of you to believe, but the worst case scenario - unemployment, bankruptcy, foreclosure - still makes me feel more optimistic about the future than the prospect of ignoring that force.</p><p>That's all.  Gotta finish a show.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/11/and-i-bid-you-goodnight" title="Permalink">And I bid you goodnight...</a></h2>
		<p>Well, campers, the day has come.  Regular readers of this blog might be a little less surprised about this particular piece of news, but I'm pretty surprised to be writing it.  I've been writing it in my head for a few weeks now, but now that I'm sitting here, I don't really know how to put it.</p><p>I joined this band at the age of 24 to accomplish a few objectives.  I was barely a year out of college and was already tired of washing dishes and rolling burritos for a living, so I prayed for a gig.  I met John Skehan within a week, and the rest is history.  What I wanted then was to get out of the kitchen and play professionally (with my college educated hands), to travel, and to learn about the music business.  Check, check, and check.  I never intended to be a touring musician for the rest of my life, and have proceeded to plan my life with my wife and our son and our dogs accordingly.  We played Red Rocks a couple of months ago.  Icing on the cake.</p><p>About a year and a half ago (as regular readers know), the flame of my creativity began lighting a different path than the one that I was on with RRE.  I'd always been pretty good with computers.  I only recently realized that the main reason that I like recording and production so much was mainly because it involves using and being good with computers.  It took an iPhone to spark the idea that I should take matters into my own hands and start learning how to program myself.  So, for the last 18 months, that's what I've been doing.  I'm not quite to the point that I'm ready to make a living with it, but God has taken care of me and me family so far, so I have to place my trust in him now.</p><p>I had a medium-range plan that had me exiting RRE at the end of next year - 2010 - and dovetailing my present and future careers together the best I could in the meantime.  Then a record deal came along.  I'm a lawyer's son, so when it became apparent that this deal was probably going to actually happen, it kinda screwed up my plan.  I couldn't sign a piece of paper committing myself to RRE and touring for the next 3 or 4 years when I knew good and well that I didn't have it in me.  That's when I knew I had to tell my bandmates what was going on with me.  Needless to say, they were probably a little surprised themselves.  I gave them until the end of next May, but they've rightly decided that since a new record needs to be written, and we won't be on the road while that's happening, it's probably best to just go ahead and call it.</p><p>I'm not sure what the future holds, but I've got a few ideas.  I know how much RRE means to many of you, and many of you probably think I've gone off my rocker reading this, but I have to ask you to trust me.  RRE has meant a lot to me, too.  I'm lucky to be able to say goodbye to a few of my favorite cities in America - Denver, San Francisco, and Portland - before hanging up my cables after the New Year.  RRE is an unbelievably good band, and I have no doubt that they'll pick a worthy successor for me.  At the very least they won't have to talk some kid into sleeping on hotel floors for weeks on end anymore.</p><p>To my bandmates I want to extend my deepest thanks for the opportunity to do exactly what I always dreamed of doing for the last 7 years, and to play the best music I'll probably ever play.  To Mikey and J Ro and Phil and Stacy and Alex and especially Gayle I want to say thanks for working way harder than I ever did to make sure that RRE not only had people at the show but that they were lavished in the most inviting atmosphere possible, even at the Nick in Birmingham.  To Brian I want to say thanks for talking me into such a ridiculous situation in the first place and for everything that you've done for RRE.  And lastly to all the strangers who have become fans who have become friends, I will miss the hell out of y'all, but I won't be too hard to find either.  I have an entire industry to try and save now, for the benefit of musicians and music lovers alike, and I'll need all the help and support I can get.</p><p>Thanks for the ride, and I'll leave you with a little Gillian Welch...</p><embed src='http://johnnygrubb.com/swf/audio_player.swf?audio_file=http://www.tumblr.com/audio_file/240597614/tumblr_ksyoc1eCsy1qzc86k&color=FFFFFF' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' height='27' quality='best' width='207' /><p class='alert'>EDIT : I'm going to be checking in here frequently over the next several weeks as this process unfolds.  I had a thought during last night's show that it'd probably be very helpful to me and informative for you if I use this blog as a tool to try and explain to you just what I'm so fired up about that I'd quit a fantastic band to go do it.

My only other freelance programming buddy out there uses Subversion, so of course I decided to go Git.  Git has a great  site that will store your code for you called <a href='https://github.com/'>GitHub</a> - they kinda go hand in hand.  It's a fun and relatively easy place to start getting familiar with the process of controlling your code.  I've been working out of a Rails book and am pushing the practice project that I'm working on up to GitHub.  The best thing about Git for me has been that it only took me about 2 days worth of hacking and poking around to get it running like it's supposed to be.  This is in stark contrast to the week or so I spent trying to get Subversion happening before basically giving up.  I understand the concepts behind Git's system of source control much better than I understand Subversion, as well.  And GitHub is a (for now) free place to upload my stuff.</p><p>The reason this excites me so is that I've embarked on a learning project.  I briefly exposed my intentions yesterday on this blog, so if you get this via RSS, you probably already have the idea.  For those of you browsing the web version, the idea is basically a simple photo sharing site for wayward musicians.  I got the idea from a great piece of dressing room graffiti in Cleveland at the Beachland Ballroom, and the domain just happened to be available although admittedly of questionable taste.  Perfect for musicians, I think.  So I've decided to try and build this thing as a Rails project.  That should make it functional, but gritty and cheap looking, just like it should be.  Anyway.  Have fun out there...</p>

The purpose of this little feature isn't just to send copies of important emails to yourself for archival purposes.  Let's have an example...</p><p>Let's say you have a really enthusiastic bud-die that's always sending links to music that he's uploaded to all his friends.  You hugely appreciate the thought every time you get one of his treats.  But then it happens.  Someone accidentally hits "reply all" on the email.  Pretty soon one person's personalized shout out is sent to the entire list, even though the intended recipient is only one person.  How best to avoid this <em>faux pas petit</em>?  Blind Carbon Copy.</p><p>Ideally, you'd put yourself in the to: field and everyone else in the BCC field.  This way, not only are you not exposing the email addresses of all of your friends to the whole world, when someone inevitably hits the "reply all" button, it's cool.  They don't have any names on the list except the original sender, and the world is just that much happier.</p><p>Thus concludes today's lesson in etiquette and irony from yours truly.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When U2 takes the stage in Los Angeles’ Rose Bowl Stadium this Sunday, fans in the United States and 15 other countries will be able to watch the whole show, live and for free, on YouTube — the first time the website has ever broadcast a complete concert live.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Are you kidding me? This is the first time that YouTube has broadcast a concert live? Did I somehow get teleported back to 2006? I would think that news of this nature would seem a lot more like news back then, but seriously?</p>

<p>The first time <em>ever</em>?</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m not as late to the party as I thought with all this, y&#8217;know, technology stuff. I guess giant-mega-corp will always move this slowly. Is it already time to add Google to the Dinosaur List?</p>

		<p>It appears that the creative fire feels like being spent on writing again, finally.  So if may I impart a bit of what I've learned in the last few months...</p><p>Before you set up that Blogspot account, I just want to call your attention to a few of the other offerings out there.  Blogger/Blogspot is an extremely simple way to get going, but there are even simpler ways to get going, if that's what you're going for.  There are also offerings out there that will allow you a much greater amount of flexibility in what you do with your new blog, should you want to go bigger.  And now...</p><p>My new favorite social website is <a href='http://www.tumblr.com/'>Tumblr</a>, hands down.  Right there on the front page of the site, in 40 pt font is the slogan "the easiest way to blog".  I'd have to agree.  You don't have to give them anything about your identity if you don't want, and you can create your own subdomain, just like Blogger.  What Tumblr has over Blogger is a much more refined design.  There are a bunch of templates to choose from, just like Blogger, but I find them to be a little more easy on the eyes, and thus easier to read and navigate - all important to the blogging experience, wouldn't you say?  If all you want to do is start letting some of your thoughts out of your head in blog form, give it a whirl.  Oh yeah, you can point <a href='http://johnnygrubb.com/'>your own domain</a> at Tumblr instead of using whatever.tumblr.com as your URL.</p><p>If you need to build something a little more extensive, say a website for your classroom's parents to keep up with their kids and their activities, I'd highly recommend <a href='http://wordpress.com/'>Wordpress.com</a>.  They too have a number of different design templates to choose from (though not as many as Tumblr), so setting up a blog that feels like you isn't too much of a challenge.  The great thing about Wordpress, the framework on which this website also runs, is that you can build outward.  Say you want to have a contact page, and a calendar of events on another page, etc, you can do that pretty easily (and quickly) with Wordpress.  Hopefully my buddy Jimmy doesn't mind my linking to <a href='http://mrsapia108.wordpress.com/'>his classroom website</a> as a fantastic example of what a smart person can do with WordPress in a short amount of time.</p><p>You really should have a blog by this point.  Make it recipes or pictures or whatever, but it's free and it's fun.  Just do it...</p>

		<p>This is not for programmers.  This is for myself, because when I first started poking at Rails 6 months ago, I didn't have any idea why I needed to edit a migration file, much less what a migration was, except that it must have something to do with a database.  I only knew that because of the command </p><code>$>rake db:migrate</code><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;p&gt; that I was told to perform and the fact that it had the letters &quot;db&quot; in it.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&apos;s the deal.  This morning I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/10/chapter-6a-version-control/&quot;&gt;version control&lt;/a&gt; and it&apos;s place in the life cycle of your application.  What version control does is keep track of the changes that you make to your applications source code from start to finish (whenever that is).  The only problem with this is that a big chunk of the data &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; functionality of a modern web application doesn&apos;t reside in the app&apos;s source code, it resides in the database, and nobody has invented an efficient version control system for a database yet.  Some friends of mine have tipped me off to different methods that they&apos;ve used - mostly around writing down DB schema changes into a text file that then gets placed under version control with the rest of the source.  That&apos;s not entirely efficient, though, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby on Rails has come up with a system called &quot;migrations&quot;.  Actually, someone surely came up with this way before Rails was invented, but I&apos;m new here, so feel free to correct me in the comments section down there.  Let&apos;s say you create a new rails app (This is directly from the awesome book &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Web-Development-Rails-Third/dp/1934356166/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1255546866&amp;sr=8-1&quot;&gt;Agile Web Development with Rails&lt;/a&gt;&quot; by a bunch of smart folks, and this example is the beginning of building a shopping cart system) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&gt;rails newapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This generates a load of boilerplate code which makes up the bones of any Rails app.  That means that instead of spending the first week of the development cycle sitting there writing low-level code that provides primordial programmatic structure, you can spend it writing code that actually does something that you (or your client) can interact with.  Let&apos;s keep it as simple as possible and say that you are going to have three fields that will be stored in the database to start. Rails let&apos;s you run this scaffold generating command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&gt;ruby script/generate scaffold product title:string description:text image_url:string&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This command runs a ruby script that builds a LOT of code for you, so much that you&apos;re only minutes away from tinkering around and you only started a few minutes before that.    This command creates the &quot;products model&quot;, which is how a programmer says that they are going to start by creating some place for the admin to store the products that they want to sell online.  The fields that were initially created were for the name of the product, the description, and the URL where you&apos;re storing the picture of the product.  Don&apos;t worry about it too much, but take a look at the command up there, it&apos;ll make sense if you know what a string is.  Just know that the data entered into these fields is going to get stored in a database.  Wait, how are we gonna store this stuff in our database?  Have we even created the tables for the database yet?  No.  Rails does it for us.  Here&apos;s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the files that is created when we run that scaffold generator is called a &quot;migration file&quot;.  This migration file is what actually creates the tables in the database, the columns in the tables, and can even populate the tables with data (used for testing), depending on what you do to the migration file.  There is a command (or method if you&apos;re OOP savvy) created when the scaffold is run called the &quot;up method&quot;.  That&apos;s the one that changes your database.  There is also a &quot;down method&quot;, which is what undoes the changes to your database.  When you run the good old &lt;code&gt;rake db:migrate&lt;/code&gt; command Rails goes applies the appropriate changes to your database for you, and provides a way to undo them later.  So, your client comes in and wants to add a Price column to the store.  In the old days, you&apos;d execute this SQL statement :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE products ADD column price DECIMAL (8,2) NOT NULL;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if you wanted to undo that?  That&apos;s a command you ran there, not some source code that you can save and delete later if you change a few things.  You can&apos;t place SQL statements under version control.  You&apos;d have to go and type that statement into the text file that was under version control, and then hope that you could effectively backtrack to it later if you wanted.  If your application and it&apos;s database have come a ways since that command you&apos;re going to have a good time figuring out how to undo it.  Rails doesn&apos;t make you do that.  In fact, you almost never are going to talk directly to your database in Rails.  Instead, you go to the most recent migration file (which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; source code and thus under version control) and alter a line to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;add_column :products, :price, :decimal,
:precision =&gt; 8, :scale =&gt; 2, :default =&gt; 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you run a script that alters the database for you.  Below this add column instruction, or &quot;up method&quot;, you add the remove column instruction, or &quot;down method&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;remove_column :products, :price&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the undo button for your database and any schema changes along the way.  Since this command is under version control, and since you&apos;re not directly interacting with your database, and since Rails knows how and which migrations to apply and in what order if you ever want to go back to a previous version, you&apos;ve just made your life a LOT easier.  Now if you only understood what the hell you were talking about!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a vastly better explanation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html&quot;&gt;try here&lt;/a&gt;.  Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

		<h2><a href="/2009/10/chapter-6a-version-control" title="Permalink">Chapter 6a - Version Control</a></h2>
		<p>So it's been a while, eh?  Not too much in the mood to write about what I've learned when most of what I've learned is how much I have to learn, y'know?  Anyway, I've been back into Ruby on Rails lately, since Ruby has got to be the dead simplest real programming language out there.  Oh yeah, and I have a major project cooking on Rails, but I'll elaborate later.  Let's talk about version control...</p><p>Let's pretend you're typing that last term paper in college.  This is the modern era, so we're using a word processing program.  That program has eaten a few of our papers over the course of our college career, so we know to save our paper often.  This is a huge paper, so we've also decided that it'd be prudent to save it under different names as it progresses so that we can go back in time to an earlier version with no hassle, y'know just in case we stray too far from the objective in the future.  This is basically the same idea behind version control.</p><p>When dudes or dudettes are sitting at their text editors coding away at whatever they're coding, in whatever language, they're typing characters into a keyboard, just like I am now.  The difference with software is that there are usually numerous files that all relate to each other in some way, and a change in any one of those files will impact the entire application.   So say you make one little change here and another little change there, and then you skip over to another file and make a change there, and then you skip over to another file and make a couple of changes there.  How the hell are you supposed to keep track of all that?  Version control.</p><p>Whatever the flavor - <a href='http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/'>CVS</a>, <a href='http://subversion.tigris.org/'>Subversion</a>, <a href='http://git-scm.com/'>Git</a> - all version control systems track changes made to the files in your fledging (or production) application.  The manner in which they do this varies from system to system, and they all have their proponents and detractors, but that you have GOT to be familiar with at least one of them is beyond dispute.  These will give you the ability to hack around all you want in the comfort of knowing that you can roll these changes back if you're not getting anywhere.</p><p>Now, the only problem with all of these version control systems is that they don't track changes to databases.  The reason that this is a big deal is that the vast majority of large, modern, dynamic websites store a lot of data in their database.  Some content management systems like Drupal actually store templates that determine how the website gets rendered to your browser in their database by default.  You can change this if you know what you're doing, and that assumes a lot.  Nothing is going to change the fact that many database powered websites have to occasionally make changes to the layout (schema) of their database to incorporate new features and the like.  The new Like feature on that site probably has it's value stored in a column somewhere in a database.  What if that feature sucks or is buggy?  How can you roll back a database to an earlier state without using up your quota of blood pressure meds too soon?  Under traditional version control systems, you can't.</p><p>Luckily, someone has figured this out for us.  It's called a "migration".  I'll be back.  I promise...</p>

That's because when these people go out for dinner, they go to chain restaurants. These are the tourists in New York who seek out the familiar Olive Garden instead of walking down the street to Pure.

That's fine. It's a personal choice.

But it got me thinking about the difference between apparent and actual risk, and how that choice affects just about everything we do.

The concierge at a fancy hotel spends her time helping tourists and business travelers avoid apparent risk. She'll book the boring, defensible, consistent tour, not the crazy guy who's actually a trained architect and a dissident. She'll recommend the restaurant from Zagats, not from Chowhound.

Apparent risk is what keeps someone working at a big company, even if it's doing layoffs. It feels safer to stay there than to do the (apparently) insanely risky thing and start a new venture.

Apparent risk is what gets someone who is afraid of plane crashes to drive, even though driving is more dangerous.

Apparent risk is avoiding the chance that people will laugh at you and instead backing yourself into the very real possibility that you're going to become obsolete or irrelevant.

When things get interesting is when the apparently risky is demonstrably safer than the actually risky. That's when we sometimes become uncomfortable enough with our reliance on the apparent to focus on the actual. Think about that the next time they make you take off your shoes at the airport."</p><p>(Via <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/'>Seth's Blog</a>.)</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/08/tall-trees-crowding-out-saplings" title="Permalink">on the tall trees crowding out the saplings</a></h2>
		<p>Someone left this as a comment for me on Facebook (I think), something in reference to a snarky status update I made about Phish and my not really giving much of a shit about them. I meant this in a mildly light-hearted manner, but I got more comments on it than most Railroad Earth updates get. People get fired up about some Phish, boy!</p>

<p>I will admit a certain amount of aggravation at Phish, not because they haven&#8217;t worked their butts off to get where they are, and not because they aren&#8217;t smart and well-managed with good music to boot (to some), but for other socio-economic reasons. Whomever posted the comment about the tall trees crowding out the saplings has a very definite point, and one that speaks to the core of the problem with the music business. In the 5 years since Phish &#8220;retired&#8221; an entire festival culture managed to spring up in it&#8217;s place. I don&#8217;t personally believe that Wakarusa, Bonnaroo, Rothbury, or any of the rest of them would&#8217;ve have been able to take root and become the ecosystem that they have without Phish&#8217;s absence. And for Phish to come back at the time that they did - with the economy already in the shitter and festivals thusly placed on shaky financial ground - seems a little bit rude to me, as a casual observer.</p>

<p>Now, why should Phish give a rats ass about Langerado? They shouldn&#8217;t, I suppose, because business is business. If Phish has a superior product to whatever festival or band might otherwise get the attendance and people vote with their wallets to go to Phish, then more power to them. Personally, I hope once this year is over and people have gotten their fix Phish either goes back to cashing checks from their investments or sees some decline in their numbers next year. I don&#8217;t care how good they are, how big they are, how hard they&#8217;ve worked, or how long they&#8217;ve been around, Phish is a Dinosaur exacerbating the issues that have essentially taken down the old way and are keeping a chosen few on life support. They become a logo for the popular music press to feel like they&#8217;ve given some face-time to the &#8220;alternative&#8221;. They become an easy distraction for music lovers out there that would otherwise be looking for a new band, a relevant band, to follow around. I&#8217;m not just talking about RRE. I&#8217;m talking about every band and festival in our scene.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t personally feel that Phish&#8217;s return has impacted RRE one single bit, for better or for worse, but I do get the sense that something very big has entered our ecosystem here, and I don&#8217;t want to be anywhere near it, ever. Sorta like the T Rex in Jurassic Park&#8230;</p>

		<p>We played in Toronto last night. It was our first Canadian gig and it went well. The club wasn&#8217;t much to speak of, but that&#8217;s to be expected from our first time in a new market. The promoter was pleased with the turnout, though earlier in the day there was a bit of handwringing over the lack of presold tickets. According to him people don&#8217;t want to pay the TicketMaster surcharge, which adds up to well over half the base ticket price. This is from the mouth of the Live Nation promoter - &#8220;people don&#8217;t want to pay the ridiculous TicketMaster surcharge&#8221;. I thought that dovetailed nicely with <a href='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/08/the-concert-biz/'>yesterday's post</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, I should do more writing on music, I think. That&#8217;s obviously where I have a great deal more experience and relative expertise than software but it&#8217;s just so old hat for me. I&#8217;ve turned to the software business as a mental escape from sitting in the van/bus and thinking about the music business. I&#8217;m tired of the music business. I&#8217;ve learned pretty much everything I care to know about the music business. So why keep doing it?</p>

<p>I was in a pretty lame mood yesterday. Toronto is very cool - at least the hood we were in - but I get burnt out on the traveling and the being gone from Michelle and Noah approximately two hours after I walk out the door. We&#8217;ve been in a tour bus for the last year, and the memory of being in the van is still fresh in my mind. The opening act last night was grilling me after the show about what it&#8217;s like to ride in a bus. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but you can get real tired of traveling around no matter what the vehicle.&#8221; I&#8217;ll elaborate on professional bus travel in another post.</p>

<p>We played a great show last night, though.</p>

<p>After the show I remember thinking (because I wrote it down) &#8220;as tired as I am of traveling, that&#8217;s as good as we&#8217;re playing&#8221;. Meaning - all the glamour, the novelty, and the fun of traveling America has completely and utterly worn off by this point. The only thing that keeps me going is the music, and the music has been better than ever lately. Two nights ago at Niagara Falls I played better than I ever have before, without effort, and this has been happening a lot lately. I&#8217;ve been more often reaching a deeply meditative state while we play, I call it the Coltrane Zone. The music flows without thought to get in the way, and it&#8217;s the most spiritual feeling I know. That&#8217;s why I keep doing this.</p>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;=&gt;Reprinted with permission from &lt;a href=&quot;http://calacanis.com/&quot;&gt;Jason Calacanis&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mahalo.com/&quot;&gt;Mahalo.com&lt;/a&gt; and co-founder of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://calacanis.com/www.techcrunch50.com&quot;&gt;TechCrunch50.com&lt;/a&gt; conference taking place on September 14-15th in San Francisco.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;About six years and $20,000 ago, I made the switch to Apple products after a 20-year love affair with Microsoft. That love affair started with the humble PCjr and ended with an IBM ThinkPad. From DOS to the first version of Windows (the run-time version that only loaded one program), and on to Windows 95 and XP, I dealt with the viruses, driver incompatibilities and other assorted quirks of Microsoft’s wildly open ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sucked to have to buy anti-virus software and reinstall Windows every 12 months, so moving to Apple’s rock-solid and virus-free OS was, in a word, delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, everything on the Mac platform costs twice as much, but considering the fact that my entire career centers around a desktop connected to the Internet, it really doesn’t matter if I spend $2 a day or $20 a day for my hardware. I replace everything at about a two-year pace (i.e. phone, MP3 player, desktop and laptop). So, at $10 a day, what some folks spend on Starbucks, I have a two year budget of $7,500 for my gear. In fact, the only things I don’t replace every two years are my 30″ and 24″ Dell Monitors, which I tend to keep for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 12-18 months, my love affair with Apple has waned. Steve Jobs’ peculiar, rigidly closed, and severe worldview have started to cramp my style. It’s not entirely Steve’s fault, as Apple’s style and grace are a large part of what drew me to the platform initially. My collection of Mac products now includes seven iPods ($1,500), four Mac laptops ($8,000), two Airports ($500), a Time Capsule ($500), two Mac towers ($4,000), a Mac Mini ($600), two iMacs ($4,000) and all three iPhones ($1,500).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of these items is just over $20,000, or about $3,300 a year. That’s almost exactly $10 a day–what I budget for technology in my life. Half of that is personal, half of that is probably business. While I know I am a high-end consumer, since I do this for a living, I think there are many folks putting $5-10 a day toward hardware. Blogger Robert Scoble of RackSpace must spend $20 a day and Leo Laporte of This Week in Tech must spend $40 a day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Point 1: For the past six years, if Steve makes something, I buy it. Sometimes, I buy two (one for my wife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Point 2: I over-pay for Apple products because I perceive them to be better (i.e. Windows-based hardware is 30-50% less–but at 38 years old I don’t care).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Love Affair Ends&lt;br /&gt;
===================&lt;br /&gt;
Steve’s a great guy, and the love affair has been wonderful, but I’m starting to look past him and back to Microsoft for a more healthy relationship that is less–wait for it–anti-competitive in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years and years after Microsoft’s antitrust headlines, Apple is now the anti-competitive monster that Jobs rallied us against in the infamous 1984 commercial. Steve Jobs is the oppressive man on the jumbotron and the Olympian carrying the hammer is the open-source movement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For folks in the tech industry, this is not a new discussion. Another radical visionary, Steve Gillmor, has been hosting this discussion since Apple’s draconian iTunes updates led smart people to *downgrade* their software. Think about that mind bomb for a second: people downgrading their software to maintain their freedoms–is this a William Gibson novel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs is on the cusp of devolving from the visionary radical we all love to a sad, old hypocrite and control freak–a sellout of epic proportions.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ * Important Note: I&apos;ve written this piece three times over the past year and never released it. It felt like releasing something like this about a personal hero when they were, according to all counts, dying was too harsh. With Steve back to work and healthy for what will probably be his last five to ten years of full-time work (based on when most folks retire), I feel obligated to let this out. I know many folks in the industry are saddened to see our LSD-taking, radical free-thinking and fight the power hero, turning to the Dark Side. This note is written from a place of admiration and love.   ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Case, The Five Parts&lt;br /&gt;
===================&lt;br /&gt;
I’d like to discuss four major issues around Apple’s current product line that I believe are stifling the industry, consumer choice and pricing. Instead of just giving a simple solution to the problem, I thought long and hard about the opportunities for Apple to be less controlling and more open. For example, if the iPhone was available on more carriers, Apple would sell many, many more units, which would inevitably lead to people switching from Windows desktops to Macs (which is what happened with the iPod).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Of all the companies in the United States that could possibly be considered for anti-trust action, Apple is the lead candidate. The US Government, however, seems to be obsessed with Microsoft for legacy reasons and Google for privacy reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, Google has absolutely no lock-in, collusion or choice issues like Apple’s, and the Internet taught Microsoft long ago that open is better than closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the case against, and the opportunities for, Apple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices&lt;br /&gt;
——————————————————–&lt;br /&gt;
There is no technical reason why the iTunes ecosystem shouldn’t allow the ability to sync with any MP3 player (in fact, iTunes did support other players once upon a time), save furthering Apple’s dominance with their own over-priced players. Quickly answer the following question: who are the number two and three MP3 players in the market? Exactly. Most folks can’t name one, let alone two, brands of MP3 players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my trips to Japan, China and Korea over the past couple of years, I made it a point to visit the consumer electronics marketplaces like Akihabira. They are filled with not dozens, but hundreds, of MP3 players. They are cheap, feature-rich and open in nature. They have TV tuners, high-end audio recorders, radio tuners, dual-headphone jacks built-in and any number of innovations that the iPod does not. You simply will not see those here because of Apple’s inexcusable lack of openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does Apple not build in a simple API to attach devices to iTunes, they actually fight technically and legally block people from building tools to make iTunes more compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think for a moment about what your reaction would be if Microsoft made the Zune the only MP3 player compatible with Windows. There would be 4chan riots, denial of service attacks and Digg’s front page would be plastered with pundit editorials claiming Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer were Borg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, then, does Steve Jobs get a pass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs gets a pass because we are all enabling him to be a jerk. We buy the products and we say nothing when our rights are stripped away. We’ve been seduced by Steve Jobs: he lifts another shiny object over his head with a new eco-friendly feature and we all melt like screaming schoolgirls at Shea Stadium in ‘65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple solution and opportunity: An iTunes API which allows the attachment of any mass storage device,not just a short list of players that jumped through Apple’s hoops. If need be, perhaps consumers pay a simple licensing fee of $1-5 a unit to attach a non-Apple MP3 player to iTunes (i.e. pure profit for Apple).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Monopolistic practices in telecommunications&lt;br /&gt;
——————————————————–&lt;br /&gt;
Apple’s iPhone is a revolutionary product that has devolved almost all of the progress made in cracking–wait for it–AT&amp;T’s monoply in the ’70s and ’80s. We broke up the Bell Phone only to have it put back together by the iPhone. Telecommunications choice is gone for Apple users. If you buy an Apple and want to have a seemless experience with your iPhone, you must get in bed with AT&amp;T, and as we like to say in the technology space, ‘AT&amp;T is the suck.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple solution and opportunity: Not only let the iPhone work on any carrier, but put *two* SIM card slots on the iPhone and let users set which applications use which services. (Your phone could be Verizon and your browser Sprint!) Imagine having two SIM cards with 3G that were able to bond together to perform superfast uploads and downloads to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Draconian App Store policies that are, frankly, insulting&lt;br /&gt;
——————————————————–&lt;br /&gt;
Like lemmings, we fell for your bar charts extolling the openness of the iPhone App platform and its massive array of applications. We over-paid for your phone–which you render obsolete every 13 months, like clockwork–and then signed our lives away to AT&amp;T. The way you pay us back is by becoming the thought police, deciding what applications we can consume on the device we over-paid for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, every application on the phone has to approved by Apple, and if you were interested in something adult in nature…well…you can’t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s justification for this nonsense is that they have to protect AT&amp;T’s network. Oh really? Aren’t there dozens and dozen of open phones on everyone’s network? The network hasn’t crashed yet, and even if someone did create a malicious iPhone application, you would know EXACTLY who was running the application and be able to block and/or turn off their phone. The network was MADE to deal with these issues on a NETWORK level. To say you have to control people down to the application level defies all logic. A second year CS student understands this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who in their right mind feels the need to control the application-level anyway? It’s absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a moment if every application on Windows Mobile or Windows XP had to be approved by Microsoft–how would you react? Exactly. Once again we’ve enabled Steve Jobs’ insane control freak tendencies. This relationship is beyond disfunctional–we are co-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple solution: Apple could have a basic system setting that says ‘Allow Non-Approved Applications.’ When you click this setting, a popup could come on warning that, if you click this setting, you are waiving your previously-understood customer service arrangement (i.e. only people with approved applications can hand over their money at the Genius bar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Being a horrible hypocrite by banning other browsers on the iPhone&lt;br /&gt;
——————————————————–&lt;br /&gt;
Opera is a fantastic browser built by a company in Oslo, Norway. In fact, a decade ago, I had a speaking gig there and got to interview the CEO of the company for Silicon Alley Reporter. (Sidebar: Man, do I miss being a journalist. I wish I could split 50% of my time being a journalist and 50% of my time being a CEO.) For over a decade, Opera has been making lighting-fast, lightweight and quirky browsers. Long before Apple launched Safari, with the goal of designing the fastest browswer on the Web, Opera was already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opera’s mobile browsers are ‘full of WIN,’ as the kids like to say these days. If you’re a Windows Mobile or Blackberry user, you’ve probably downloaded them and enjoyed their WINness. The company started an iPhone browser project but gave up when faced with Apple’s absurd and unclear mandate to developers: Don’t create services which duplicate the functionality of Apple’s own software. In other words: ‘Don’t compete with us or we will not let you in the game.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony of this is not lost on anyone who had a computer before they had an Internet connection. Apple was more than willing to pile on after Microsoft’s disasterous inclusion of Internet Explorer with Windows. In fact, what Apple is doing is 100x worse than what Microsoft did. You see, Microsoft simply included their browser in Windows, still allowing other browsers to be installed. In Apple’s case, they are not only bundling their browser with the iPhone, but they are BLOCKING other browsers from being installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple solution and opportunity: Don’t be a control freak and hypocrite. Allow people to pick their browser; the competition to make a better browser will increase the overall use of iPhones and mobile data services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Blocking the Google Voice Application on the iPhone&lt;br /&gt;
——————————————————–&lt;br /&gt;
Apple took Google’s innovative and absurdly priced phone offering, Google Voice, out of the App Store and is currently being investigated by the FCC for this action. This point is similar to the browser issue, in that Apple wants to own almost every extension of the iPhone platform. How long before Apple decides to ban a Twitter client in favor of an Apple Twitter-like product? Seems crazy, I know, but by following Apple’s logic you should not be able to use Firefox or Google Chrome on your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple solution and opportunity: Let people have three or four phone services coming in to their iPhones and perhaps charge a modest licensing fee for those types of service. Or, just simply stop being jerks and let the free market decide how to use the data services they’ve BOUGHT AND PAID FOR. That’s the joke of this: you’re paying for the data services that Apple is blocking. You pay for the bandwidth and Apple doesn’t let you use it because, you know, they know better than you how you should consume your data minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Summary&lt;br /&gt;
——————————————————–&lt;br /&gt;
I’m not a huge fan of government involvement in business, so I would rather see Apple resolve these issues for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I believe many forces are already at work, with Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and Peter Rojas of GDGT.com (and founder of Engadget) coming out publicly against these very issues. Neither of these two individuals will use an iPhone *specifically* because it is incompatible with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple will face a user revolt in the coming years based upon Microsoft, Google and other yet-to-be-formed companies, undercutting their core markets with cheap, stable and open devices. Apple’s legendary comeback ability will be for naught if they don’t deeply examine their anti-competitive nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making great products does not absolve you from technology’s cardinal rule: Don’t be evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also doesn’t save you from Scarface’s cardinal rule: Never get high on your own supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Do you think Apple would be more, or less, successful if they adopted a more open strategy (i.e. allowing other MP3 players in iTunes)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Do you think Apple should face serious antitrust action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Do you think Apple’s dexterity and competence forgive their bad behavior?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason&lt;/p&gt;

		<h2><a href="/2009/08/the-concert-biz" title="Permalink">the concert biz.</a></h2>
		<p>I read a piece the other day that really irritated the holy crap out of me. An acquaintance had posted a link to <a href='http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/08/02/the-concert-business/'>this article</a> proclaiming the &#8220;implosion of the concert business&#8221;. The examples he cites - Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, U2 - are all apparently seeing a downturn in their ticket sales for their most recent runs. This is not surprising to me and I assumed that it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to anyone, but according to Mr. Lefsetz it&#8217;s a cause of concern for many a concert promoting Dinosaur.</p>

<p>This is the section that really kills me :</p>
<blockquote>Maybe no one cares to the equivalent of a multiplatinum level anymore.  Maybe the live business has to give that paradigm up.  At least for a decade, until new acts are grown.

We want music that resonates.  And we want music.  Lady GaGa is outfits.  Katy Perry is so second rate she’s third rate.  The future looks more like the Kings Of Leon.  A band that’s been around for years that finally breaks through.  And doesn’t break the bank when it sets ticket prices.</blockquote>
<p>Now, ignoring the casual inattention to building proper sentences, he does make a salient point. If&#8217;n there is a decline in the overall concert business, it&#8217;s obviously a parallel to the decline in the record business. I do believe that P2P sharing played a part in killing the record business of yore, but no more than the CD-R, no more than the laptop computer, and certainly not as much as the overall disposable quality of pop music over the last 15 years. People don&#8217;t want to see those acts live. And the Kings of Leon? They&#8217;re the future? So, the future looks exactly like the past - young, pretty kids that sound and act like the Rolling Stones that have a sugar-coated and easily swallowed press story. Kill yourself.</p>

<p>The reason that this depresses me is that the entire music business still views itself through the same lens that it has for the last 20 years - huge amounts of money to be made from relatively little effort, and if it doesn&#8217;t pay off there are a hundred other candidates waiting to get in line for their shot. Not a single thought is paid to building a business (act) in the time tested manner that every other business has to go through in order to turn a long-term profit. The Police didn&#8217;t do much on their first two albums, but 2 years after that they were the biggest act in the world. Luckily their label didn&#8217;t dump them, or who would headline Bonnaroo 25 years on?</p>

<p>Just a side question - Who&#8217;s gonna play the Super Bowl Half Time show in 10 years? Death Cab for Cutie?</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/08/golden-age-software-business" title="Permalink">The golden age of the software business.</a></h2>
		<blockquote>And speaking of widgets, reports out today claim that Verizon is about to open its "Widget Bazaar" wider to developers in a bid to create an "app store" similar to the iPhone's.  Like the iPhone store, there will be an approval process, and developers will be able to charge for their applications, with the revenue split likely being 70% to the developer and 30% to Verizon.</blockquote>
<p>-&gt; From a <a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/alleyinsider/silicon_alley_insider/~3/n2q4d4vQkns/fios-20-verizon-embraces-the-internet-to-push-its-tv-service-2009-8'>BusinessInsider article</a> explaining some of the features that Verizon is rolling out on their FiOS broadband service. I hope that Verizon doesn&#8217;t take too much more from Apple&#8217;s playbook than the 30% cut and the seed of the idea on this, because a properly nurtured software market is, in my humble opinion, the future of rock and roll.</p>

<p>Despite the much advertised success, Apple actually hasn&#8217;t gotten the AppStore quite right. See <a href='http://www.polarbearfarm.com/blog/?p=124'>here</a>, <a href='http://rc3.org/2009/08/01/apple-vs-my-preconceived-notions/'>here</a> and <a href='http://dashes.com/anil/2009/07/apple-secrecy-does-not-scale.html'>here</a> for some very well reasoned complaints and observations from developers on how the process could be much more successful.</p>

<p>Chief among these complaints are the fact that the flipside of what makes Apple&#8217;s products so successful (the closed and tight-lipped Apple ecosystem) is that they have tried to exert an amount of control over the AppStore that simply isn&#8217;t feasible. The very idea of trying to &#8220;control&#8221; the open 3rd party market is an exercise in futility - Prometheus can&#8217;t un-steal the fire. Make no mistake, Steve Jobs would never have allowed 3rd party developers to start developing applications for his device had people not already been <a href='http://www.tuaw.com/2007/08/08/iphone-hacking-101-jailbreaking/'>jailbreaking</a> these phones by the hundreds of thousands. He&#8217;s not the kind of guy who likes others cramping his style and having a market of people openly hacking the OS on their iPhone definitely qualifies as cramping his style. He succeeded in stemming the tide and turning it to Apple&#8217;s advantage for a time, but the dike has been leaky the whole time. Remember the <a href='http://blogs.oreilly.com/iphone/2008/07/ing-nda.html'>NDA</a>? That&#8217;s the ham-handed non-disclosure agreement that Apple had in place on all their developers after the official release of the iPhone SDK (software developers kit) which expressly forbid anyone from even talking about iPhone development. How are people supposed to make the most of your platform when you won&#8217;t even allow a message forum for your developers to talk to each other and for newbies to learn? They did away with that provision several months ago, but their treatment of the developer community hasn&#8217;t improved much since. The great irony in all of this is that the AppStore is absolutely jam-packed with total shit at the same time that well known and respected developers are having their hard work rejected for highly dubious reasons.</p>

<p>When the day comes that someone gets the ecosystem right - meaning the proper combination of user, manufacturer, and developer base - the beginning of the golden age of software will truly have begun. Since a little over a year ago I&#8217;ve imagined where we are now in the evolution of the software biz as being sort of like the dawn of radio, in the vacuum tube/fireside chat era. The invention of the transistor (and the portable radio soon after) ushered in the golden age of the music business, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dowd'>Tom Dowd</a>/<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Ertegun'>Ahmet Ertegun</a> days, when starting a band to make a living and maybe even get rich must&#8217;ve seemed like a reasonable proposition for a person with a modest amount of musical talent. For a person or a band with a lot of talent and business acumen to support it it must&#8217;ve been like the wild west. That&#8217;s the sense I get from the software sector right now. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here.</p>

<p>The record business vein is pretty well played out by many measures, but that&#8217;s the nature of evolution. I think this little announcement by Verizon is actually big news&#8230;</p>

		<p>&#8220;This line-of-credit, the stop-gap measure that was supposed to solve the problem that hadn’t really existed in the first place had done nothing but worsen it. When we started the week, we had no liquidity issues. But because people had said that we did have problems with our capital, it became true, even though it wasn’t true when people started saying it&#8230; . So we were forced to find capital to offset the losses we’d sustained because somebody decided we didn’t have capital when we really did. So when we finally got more capital to replace the capital we’d lost, people took that as a bad sign and pointed to the fact that we’d had no capital and had to get a loan to cover it, even when we did have the capital they said we didn’t have. &#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The lesson for any artist here has to be to sign a contract with any session musicians you use to ensure that you have set out any arrangement on copyright and royalties in the product. The vast majority of modern artists will be well aware of the risks, but we could see a great number of similar cases. An ounce of protection could be worth nearly 40 years of cure.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>from a British law blog, <a href='http://www.ralli.co.uk/news?news_id=398'>Ralli Solicitors</a>. You know that tune &#8220;Whiter Shade of Pale&#8221;, that I always thought was a Steve Winwood tune? That&#8217;s by a band called Procul Harum. The keyboardist on that tune claimed &#8220;that he wrote and was responsible for the main melody of “Pale”, and as such is entitled to a share of its copyright.&#8221; He won the judgment, 40 years after the tune came out. Good for him, right? It&#8217;s a little more complicated than that.</li>

		<p>This one comes from a marketing blog called Outspoken Media. It&#8217;s a little over the top for me most of the time, and the girl Lisa that runs it most of the time has pronounced diarrhea of the keyboard (yes, I&#8217;m calling the kettle black). This post got me thinking, however&#8230;</p>

<p>The spark was with the &#8220;United Breaks Guitars&#8221; tune that&#8217;s been stuck in my head all day. I&#8217;ll ruin the surprise and tell you - she&#8217;s not that impressed. She has some interesting reasons why =&gt;</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/07/last-gasp-album" title="Permalink">The last gasp of the Album?</a></h2>
		<p>In case you don&#8217;t follow the tech press as closely as I do, Apple will be releasing a small, supposedly cheaper tablet computer intended to compete in the &#8220;netbook&#8221; market. Those are small, cheap computers that can&#8217;t really do anything but access the internet. I see them in airports a lot lately. They look annoying to use, but that&#8217;s just me. So Apple&#8217;s version will (according to rumor) look like a really large iPhone - a 9 inch or so touchscreen and no keyboard.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>&#8220;Apple wants to make bigger purchases more compelling by creating a new type of interactive album material, including photos, lyric sheets and liner notes that allow users to click through to items that they find most interesting. Consumers would be able to play songs directly from the interactive book without clicking back into Apple’s iTunes software, executives said.&#8221; - <a href='http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28129982-7a18-11de-b86f-00144feabdc0.html'>via Financial Times</a></p>

<p>This sounds like what the iPhone&#8217;s promise of a music player has been all along - crazy amounts of interaction with the content you&#8217;ve bought - but artists (save perhaps Trent Reznor) have been slow to get on board with realizing the potential. Let&#8217;s hope this will stir things up a bit.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/07/phases-iphone-ownership-hazards-love" title="Permalink">The phases of iPhone ownership, the hazards of love.</a></h2>
		<h2>Phase Four - Complacence</h2>
<p>It happens to the best of us. We sometimes take our loved ones for granted. We don&#8217;t remember the thrill of exploring the new relationship, and start to get annoyed when we&#8217;re forcibly reminded that those days are over. We see others walking around arm in arm with their new love and you think to ourselves &#8220;enjoy it while it lasts&#8221; or &#8220;I bet you just play games on that thing, don&#8217;t you, chump?&#8221; Soon, it seems like everyone has an iPhone. The 12 year old brothers across the aisle from you on the plane - why the hell do they need an iPhone? Your entire crew gets them and you just <em>know</em> they&#8217;re gonna be borrowing your charger. Yes, I&#8217;ve got my charger with me. Jesus&#8230;</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve since moved away from actually programming the thing, since object oriented programming is one giant blob of convoluted shit for a 30 year old bass player with a kid to try and pick up in his spare time. Besides, web development really seems like more bang for the buck. Might not pay as well, but this whole iPhone gold rush is pretty much over anyway. You read all the tech blogs by this point - you&#8217;ve turned your manager onto NetNewsWire before abandoning it yourself to try Google Reader but <a href='http://al3x.net/2009/07/18/fever-and-the-future-of-feed-readers.html'>you'll ditch that soon, too</a> - so you know how annoying it would be to try and get your app through <a href='http://www.marco.org/143265621'>the Apple process</a> were you even capable of coding such a thing. You don&#8217;t even check out the App Store that much anymore, since there&#8217;s nothing but a bunch of stupid <em>games</em> over there anyway.</p>
<h2>Phase Five - Resentment</h2>
<p>This began in earnest for me about three weeks ago. In fairness, it&#8217;s not completely the fault of the iPhone. A good bit of the aggravation is due to AT&amp;T&#8217;s service. It&#8217;s just not that good. It was really good (or so I thought) when I first got the thing, but I swear since however many millions of people have bought iPhones the network has gotten noticeably slower and spottier. There was a voicemail outage this past weekend that affected nearly everyone on the network whether they knew it or not. I was in St Cloud MN last night with &#8220;full bars&#8221; and 3G service, but couldn&#8217;t get a page to load all night.</p>

<p>This is pretty inexcusable to me. AT&amp;T&#8217;s one and only job - for which they are well paid - is to deliver the services that they promise. At Rothbury and Wakarusa the service was unusable and the 10,000 or so iPhoners that were at Rothbury (not an exaggeration, they were the only phone I saw all weekend, at least half the phones there it seemed) were reduced to communicating via text. Whaa, whaa you might say, and ordinarily I might agree with you, but you know what Verizon did at both of those festivals? They brought in a mobile antenna to provide service to the festival site for their customers. Does AT&amp;T even have such a truck? Could they be bothered to bring it to the festival site in the middle of nowhere where 10,000 of their customers were going to be savaging their shitty network all weekend? Apparently, no, on both counts. Inexcusable. (The upside is that someone had the good sense to put together a <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=320578228&mt=8'>Rothbury App</a> which worked great for me all weekend. The schedule was imbedded so I wasn&#8217;t reliant on the no-cell coverage and I always knew what band I was watching at the time. Very cool.)</p>

<p>The other thing that I&#8217;ve noticed in the last weeks is that the new OS 3.0 is a good bit slower than the previous version. Boot up time and app launch time, both slower. This is ostensibly because there are new features loaded into the new OS, but many of those features aren&#8217;t even available to 3G and OG iPhoners. So all we get is copy and paste and a dog of a phone. I&#8217;ll be getting the new one, whatever version it is whenever I get it, but in the meantime I&#8217;m left avariciously playing with Stacy&#8217;s new 3GS.</p>
<h2>In closing</h2>
<p>The iPhone is awesome, but if you don&#8217;t have one - wait. It will most likely be coming to Verizon sometime in the next year. I will be jumping ship when it does. My advice for the meantime - get an iPod touch and stick with your cell phone that works. There will be a new phase for me after the resolution of this current dark period while AT&amp;T gets their act together (I hope), or it goes over to Verizon, but in the meantime it&#8217;s #attfail for me.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/07/ie6" title="Permalink">IE6</a></h2>
		<p>Here&#8217;s a link to a techCrunch article that links to yet another cute little video that someone put up on YouTube. The gist is that designers and programmers hate the stupid quirks and security holes that are present in IE6 and have mounted a vigorous campaign to get corporate IT departments to finally get on with the upgrade.</p>

<p>But, I actually work a bit in corporate IT, at a call center full of computers running IE6. They&#8217;re running that way by necessity, because many of the computers in that place are so old that they won&#8217;t run an OS newer than Windows 2000. How about that techCrunch? There&#8217;s a mixture of all kinds of computers in that place and some actually do run XP, but they&#8217;re all on IE6. IT departments don&#8217;t want to have to service two different sets of software across their company, and I don&#8217;t blame them - resources are always tight and are absolutely the reason that IT depts don&#8217;t upgrade. I know IE8 is free, but what about the 40 computers that we can&#8217;t afford to replace right now that aren&#8217;t capable of running it? That and the cold, hard fact that upgrading systems across an entire company brings with it the spectre of having to teach people how to use the new way - repeatedly - and having to listen to everyone from the agents on the floor to the boss at the top complain that &#8220;there was nothing wrong with IE6, why did we have to upgrade?&#8221; To make some f-ing web designers happy?</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/23/woah-people-really-dont-like-ie6/#comments&quot;&gt;Woah, People Really Don’t Like IE6&lt;/a&gt;

edit : I love web design.  We all do.  I&apos;m envious of knowledgeable web designers.  We all are.  It is beyond argument that the world would be better off if IE6 were banished forever from all computers.  In addition to being a security risk for everyone (not just IE6 users), countless hours of otherwise productive programming and design are wasted trying to support it&apos;s dumb ass.  It is, however, a larger and more complex issue than you may realize.</pre>

		<h2><a href="/2009/07/reddit" title="Permalink">Reddit.</a></h2>
		<p>I&#8217;ve been killing time the past couple of weeks with <a href='http://Digg.com'>Digg</a> and <a href='http://reddit.com'>Reddit</a>. Yes, I just recently discovered them. The Digg experience is more polished, but Reddit feels a little bit more real. They&#8217;re both essentially services where people submit links to interesting articles that are then voted on by the crowd - up or down - and the ones that the crowd finds more interesting naturally float to the top. Reddit&#8217;s edge for me though is that users can submit their own essays for display/storage on the site - sorta like the rants and raves section on Craigslist. The health care debate has been raging (literally) for the the past couple of weeks, and I find the discussion on articles and essays to be as good as the articles themselves.</p>
<a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9354p/fuck_you_blue_cross_i_give_you_fuckers_over/'>Here's</a><!--break-->
<p>The beauty of Reddit is that it has a <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=302732279&mt=8'>great iPhone app</a>. It&#8217;s functionally just like the normal website, which is to say a little spartan in terms of design. The fantastico part of the app is it&#8217;s integration with <a href='http://www.instapaper.com/'>InstaPaper</a>. I discovered all of these services at the same time, since they basically feast off of each other (much like the tech press). InstaPaper is totally made for somebody like me. What it does is let you save stuff you want to read on the web, but don&#8217;t necessarily have the time for right then. You install a little bookmark in your browser which send the page to InstaPaper&#8217;s server. Their server then downloads the page (I think) and pulls it up for you when you go to the site later.</p>

<p>This is where it gets really good. Say you&#8217;re on the plane getting ready to pull back from the gate, about to lose cell service for however long. InstaPaper also has a <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284942713&mt=8'>great iPhone app</a> that will pull the article off the server and cache it on your phone, meaning you don&#8217;t need access to the web to read the article. It even formats it for the iPhone by pulling the stuff from between the &#8220;content&#8221; div tags, which is presumably the article that you want to read, and does away with all the bells and whistles and CSS and ads and all that. The end result isn&#8217;t perfect, but it&#8217;ll keep you busy on the plane for a while.</p>

<p>So the process for me last week was this : Reddit -&gt; find interesting article -&gt; click Save to InstaPaper. Before I got on the plane -&gt; open up InstaPaper and download everything I had marked for later. Kept me busy for most of the flight. Enjoy, news geeks&#8230;</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/07/allans-guide-running-facebook-campaign" title="Permalink">Allan's guide to running a Facebook Campaign</a></h2>
		<p>Well, friends, I asked for it. Yesterday I put up a post about Facebook&#8217;s new SMS fan feature. This lets RRE fans (or whomever) text &#8220;fan RailroadEarth&#8221; to FBOOK and they&#8217;re automatically added to our fan roster on Facebook. This sounds like an extremely convenient way to sign up new fans at a show or whenever the feeling hits them, yet there are a few hurtles from an effective marketing perspective that I wanted some feedback on. For instance, the best way to get the word out would probably be to make an announcement from the stage during the show, but RRE isn&#8217;t going to be doing that. Whatever the vibe is that we&#8217;re trying to project from stage, it ain&#8217;t the one where we stop in the middle of a set and put in a plug for our <a href='http://www.facebook.com/railroadearth'>Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>Other alternatives are placing info at the merch booth, the ubiquitous (and potentially ineffective) email blast, but obviously a coordinated effort on all fronts would be the most effective means of getting those numbers up. A coordinated effort is what Allan came up with. I&#8217;d love to hog this as proprietary information given to us, and only us, by a seasoned marketing vet for the purpose of blowing Railroad Earth up just a little bit more. However, that would be against the <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/about-ibd/'>stated mission of ignoredByDinosaurs</a>. What I present here is either something that he&#8217;d been working on for months and waiting for the right opportunity to fire off or a 30 minute rough draft of a brainstorm. You never know with that guy. Either way, he&#8217;s an impassioned student of the biz and this is good stuff. If you promote bands you should read this.</p>

<p>The funny part is, I was just kidding when I asked him to make me a diagram.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/07/phases-iphone-ownership-beginning" title="Permalink">The phases of iPhone ownership, the beginning</a></h2>
		<p>For me, it began in December of 2007. Anyone who reads this blog or has stumbled across it (as a surprising number have, unless there&#8217;s a bot out there relentlessly searching for <a href='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/04/coolest-iphone-app-ever/'>my post on the Best App Ever</a>) knows that I&#8217;m a fan. I started off as a casual appreciator of the iPhone, and have since proceeded to jettison a lifetime of loyal MS-DOS/Windows computing in favor of being a blogging, Mac toting dork. I&#8217;m not ashamed. My personal productivity has skyrocketed over the last 18 months, due almost exclusively to the tectonic shift in mindset brought about by my consumer relationship with the House of Jobs. And now, for your enjoyment (I hope), I present the emotional cycle of iPhone ownership.</p>
<h3>Prehistory</h3>
<p>It started off for me simply enough. I&#8217;d been a Cingular customer-cum AT&amp;T customer since the dawn of cell phone use (for me). I&#8217;d been through a few phones over the years, most notably the old bricky Nokia that worked great and only did that <i>one thing</i>. I was perfectly happy for a number of years, but eventually I was seduced. I wanted something with a bit more style, more pizazz. I&#8217;d been reading the <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-what-phones-are-apples-iphone-buyers-throwing-away-2009-7'>Motorola Razr</a> PR for a while, and thought that perhaps it&#8217;d make me happier, what with it&#8217;s flippy coolness and it&#8217;s camera. It even held the promise of being a music player, though a cursory glance could&#8217;ve shown a lack of a headphone jack or any real internal storage. I didn&#8217;t care!! I was leaving the droll stability of the good thing I&#8217;d had with Nokia.</p>

<p>You can tell where this is headed. The camera sucked. The phone dropped calls all the time. The flip thing bothered me as much as I always knew it would. It wouldn&#8217;t even let you set your own ringtones from your own music that you already freaking owned. It was extremely uncomfortable against your ear. It would connect to the crap ringtone store spontaneously and download the new NeYo tune for me. Repeatedly. Finally after less than 6 months, the thing just died altogether. Actually, I snapped it in half one night, so I guess you could say I terminated it, with extreme prejudice. This was about two weeks before Noah was due, so obviously I needed a new phone pronto.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d already seen Jimmy hanging out with it. He sent me an email with the signature at the bottom reading Sent from my iPhone. What a dork. I was intrigued&#8230;</p>
<h2>Phase One - Infatuation</h2>
<p>It was a rainy December day. I had a notion that since I&#8217;d just re-upped my Cingular contract months before, the new contract discount wouldn&#8217;t be applying to me on this day. The suspicion was confirmed by the (very cool and helpful) dude at the store. A new Razr would cost me $379.</p>

<p>Or I could just get an iPhone for $20 more.</p>

<p>The first week was a revelation. The mere act of checking my email and being done with it in less time than it took my POSVRPC (Piece of $h!t, Vista-running PC) to even reach the first splash screen on booting up was like a dream come true. I immediately regretted my purchase of the POSVRPC only two weeks earlier, as the iPhone could easily get me through the relatively gig-light winter. I wrote a blog on the iPhone within days on MySpace - old-school - praising Apple as the &#8220;Barry Bonds of product design - every swing, out of the park&#8221;. This was before the steroid allegations really came to light, but the comparison is probably still apropos.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d never bought an iPod, so having music to listen to was another big one. I&#8217;m sorry if I&#8217;ve written about all this before, but the real winner was when Noah was born and I had pictures emailed to the family within minutes.</p>

<p>The contacts and the calendar? I&#8217;d actually bought a Palm Pilot in college, deep in my freelance gigger days, but couldn&#8217;t make myself carry it around all the time, which seriously negated it&#8217;s effectiveness. In short, I started to see that if I couldn&#8217;t get my life together with an iPhone, I was hopeless.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="post ninecol">
		<h2><a href="/2009/07/phases-iphone-ownership-continued" title="Permalink">The phases of iPhone ownership, continued...</a></h2>
		<h2>Phase Two - Love</h2>
<p>The day that I knew I&#8217;d found the one was July 12, 2008. The 3G and the OS 2.0 software update had come out the day before. I&#8217;d updated as soon as I could, playing my part in the server issues that Apple had that day. I was fascinated by the prospect of adding apps, though I didn&#8217;t really know what I would want to add to the thing that wasn&#8217;t already there.</p>

<p>Had a nice loooong road trip down I-81 to contemplate such matters. I spent most of the ride and all of the battery perusing the app store. By the time I got to wherever we were going, my life was changed forever. &#8220;My <i>God</i>, this is going to change everything! RRE needs an app! Everybody needs an app!, if for no other reason that to format the information that&#8217;s already on our website for the mobile screen. Everybody in the future is going to be carrying these things around, so if you&#8217;re not with it, you&#8217;re a friggin Dinosaur! I wonder how you write these things? It must not be that hard - the experience is so smooth, it must be really easy! I need to do some research.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll spare the details of what I found about programming iPhone apps, since that&#8217;s basically the theme of this entire blog, but let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s a <em>bit</em> more involved than I thought.</p>

<p>My involvement with Facebook only really began after the installation of their iPhone app. Same with Twitter. Or Wordpress. Or jogging. Or blogging. And on and on. So in a way, you could say that everything I&#8217;ve gotten interested in, or re-interested in, over the last year and a half - programming, design, marketing, my band - has been because of that little doo-hicky. Thanks Steve! On the other hand, the recent dearth of LiveDownloads is also partially attributable to that thing, also, since engineering and production have kinda lost a bit of their luster as a serious career path for me. Sorry, guys. Net positive, though, to be sure.</p>
<h2>Phase Three - Seperation and reunion</h2>
<p>I lost my original iPhone. I won&#8217;t go into where, or when, or how, but it was a major bummer. I&#8217;d already bought a Mac by that point, since iPhone and Mac development doesn&#8217;t happen on a Windows machine. Oh well, twist my arm. Besides, in the year that I&#8217;d been an iPhoner, my life had slowly but surely realigned itself around being in touch and on top of things, so even if I hadn&#8217;t decided on development as a future career path I was certainly not going back to the &#8220;old way&#8221;.</p>

<p>Luckily, at the Rockaway Mall Apple store, they gave me the AT&amp;T subsidy, so that my 3G didn&#8217;t cost me a million bucks. Only half a million. The 3G, of course, has GPS, which I didn&#8217;t think was really going to be that big a deal. I was already a good navigator and always had a map in my pocket. I was wrong.</p>

<p>GPS went hand in hand with a cool app that I&#8217;d gotten just after that called <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=291890420&mt=8'>iMapMyRun</a>, which tracks your runs, your training progress, and just happens to run on that little doo-hicky that you already had in your hand since you like to listen to tunes while you jog, which, by the way, neither did you jog nor did you listen to tunes a year prior to that. Goodness. So you could definitely say that loosing my original phone turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/07/rust-kansas" title="Permalink">Rust / Kansas</a></h2>
		<p>It feels like ages since my last post, even though I&#8217;ve tried to keep it up with some links to some good dorkery. Today is spent in the bus, driving the 735 miles from Denver to Columbia, MO. We left at 9 this morning and have made a small dent in Kansas, but we&#8217;ll most likely be rolling in around midnight or so tonight. So here goes&#8230;</p>

<p>Yesterday was spent at the Mile High Music Festival in Denver, one of our hometowns. It was kind of a strange lineup - us, Ani, Ben Harper, Tool, Panic, Black Keys, India Arie. Sort of like a festival we do all the time, but not exactly. I can&#8217;t explain it without sounding like I&#8217;m getting down on the festival, but it was sorta like Rothbury without all the vibe. Now, Rothbury, there&#8217;s a festival. My friend Laura has a great blog about her involvement with the copious vibe-ification that took place. Check it out <a href='http://shaktisunfire.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/rothbury-2009/'>here</a>. It&#8217;s not kosher for me to be proclaiming any festival the &#8220;best&#8221;, but if it were&#8230;</p>

<p>Festival season aside, I&#8217;ve pretty much just been at work on Railroad Earth&#8217;s next website. After months of research, I&#8217;ve pretty well settled on WordPress as the platform and have been building for the last few weeks, talking to numerous developers and designers that can help with the look - the backend and build-out has pretty much become my baby. I&#8217;m very excited about it. I&#8217;d tell you where it&#8217;s stashed, but not only do I want it to be a surprise to as many people as possible, the metrics tell me that perhaps a few of you have already found it.</p>

<p>Pardon my lack of anything interesting to say, but my creative fire seems to go in cycles. I&#8217;ve had to venture into the woods for more firewood lately, and will hopefully have more to say one of these days.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know why it took me so long to bop on over to the app store and search Wordpress, but of course there&#8217;s an iPhone app! I&#8217;ll use it now to distract myself while Sheaffer drives us to the airport.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re headed to the Mile High music festival in Denver tonight. We&#8217;re playing tomorrow afternoon at the exact same time as Ani DiFranco, which is a real bummer because she was the best set of music I saw all weekend at Rothbury. I&#8217;d never seen her play before, and all I can say is Holy Crap. She played the Sherwood stage, which faces that forest you might have heard about. She played her song Napolean, which I&#8217;d never heard before. Sitting there on the side of the stage with her voice echoing off the forest was the best way to hear a tune like that for the first time. I&#8217;m kind of in love with her now. Anyway&#8230;</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/06/chapter-5-domains" title="Permalink">Chapter 5 - Domains</a></h2>
		<p>Bollocks!!  <strong>Do not buy a domain from Yahoo.</strong></p>

<p>I just want to make sure that shows up in the description of search results, if there are any.  Now a parable&#8230;</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Many years ago it occured to me that if I didn&#8217;t go and buy JohnnyGrubb.com, then I was stupid.  I had no idea how to make websites and no need for one whatsoever, but I did know enough to know that if I didn&#8217;t buy my own friggin name then someday I might regret it.  So, in March 2006, I bought my own name for 5 years.  Doesn&#8217;t that sound weird?   Yahoo gave me a great deal, or so I thought then.</p>

<p>I soon started getting lots of emails exhorting me to host a website with them.  Come on, it&#8217;s only $15 a month and we&#8217;ll help you make the website.  It seemed like a good deal (it wasn&#8217;t), so I did it- for about 6 months or so.  At some point I got a new Wachovia check card and didn&#8217;t update my info with Yahoo and they shut me off.  Apparently when they shut me off, they also shut off access to my domain.  I didn&#8217;t find this out until yesterday.  I&#8217;d kept an eye on it over the years to make sure that some Chinese company hadn&#8217;t stolen it from me, and according to the records, I still owned it.  Registered with Yahoo.  Cool.</p>

<p>So, yesterday, as I was switching this website over to the new host (didn&#8217;t even notice, did ya?), I got it into my head to try and point JohnnyGrubb.com over this way also.  I&#8217;m thinking that perhaps JG will be the more personal website - the one that deals more with music - and that this (ibD) will be the business (that&#8217;s presuming there&#8217;s business, I know).</p>

<p>This is when I discover that even though I own JG, Yahoo won&#8217;t let me in so I can transfer it, or even point it where I want it to go.  So now it&#8217;s time for a lesson that I learned the hard way over the last few days&#8230;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll skip the possibly fraudulent fiasco that is Yahoo Domains for now, and talk about what happens when you buy and host a domain/website.  If you&#8217;re a musician and you only buy a domain so that nobody else can buy it out from underneath you, it stays parked wherever you bought it.  You can then go forward and decide to host a website with the company where it&#8217;s registered, or you can wait and maybe host a website somewhere else.  If you decide to host somewhere else, then you have to do some configuring.  That domain that you bought is parked on a computer somewhere, and what you have to do is tell that computer to resolve any incoming requests made for johnnyGrubb.com, for example, into the proper numerical IP address for the website.  That computer is called a &#8220;nameserver&#8221;, since its job on this earth is to take the english web address and translate it into a numerical IP address.  If you want to host the website somewhere else you have to login to your Domain Control Panel, they all have &#8216;em, and tell that domain to point to your webhosts&#8217; nameserver.  This website, for example, is hosted at Media Temple, with a nameserver address of something like ns1.mediatemple.net.  I had to login over at GoDaddy and tell them that, since that&#8217;s where the domain name is registered.  When you come here MediaTemple&#8217;s nameserver gets the request and turns it into a number that the rest of their system can understand.  It&#8217;s kinda complicated at first.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s good idea to buy the domain from the same place you&#8217;re gonna host it, if you like things to be tidy.</p>

<p>I just found this all out.  The hard way.</p>

<p>Since Yahoo wouldn&#8217;t let me in to JohnnyGrubb.com&#8217;s domain control panel, I couldn&#8217;t point my name to my new web host.  Bummer.  So I had to shell out another $10 to re-register my domain with Yahoo just so I could get in there and point it in the right direction.  Jerks.  Like I said, my registration for that domain name wasn&#8217;t supposed to expire until 2012, but I figured that $10 is probably better than me spending until 2012 trying to get someone at Yahoo on the line.  They don&#8217;t even have a customer service email.  What kinda shit is that?  I even dug up the email welcoming me to Yahoo domains and clicked on the link to my domain control panel, which promptly told me &#8220;oh you must have decided to let your overpriced, crappy webhosting service lapse because we can&#8217;t let you in there.  Sorry chump.&#8221;</p>

<p>Long story short.  If you&#8217;re a casual user buy your domain at GoDaddy.  They&#8217;re at least reputable enough and I had good experiences with their customer service during my period of hosting over there.  DO NOT buy a domain from Yahoo.</p>

<p>Better yet, ask me.  I&#8217;m getting the hang of this stuff.</p>

		<p>The new host.  Hopefully you didn&#8217;t swing by herein the last three hours whilst I&#8217;ve been wrestling with moving from GoDaddy over here.  If anyone discovers anything funky, would you please let me know?  The comments are down there &#62;&#62;&#62;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m relocating some stuff this week.  I&#8217;ve just bought a year of hosting with Media Temple, which seems to be where all the cool kids are parking their websites, and trying concurrently to transfer all manner of domains and live websites to said host.  This should be a lot of fun.  I&#8217;ll probably hose a lot of stuff this week, this website, the new forum, who knows what else.  By the way, if you&#8217;re thinking about registering a domain name, don&#8217;t go Google Apps to do it.  They are a partner with GoDaddy, so just skip the middleman and go straight to GoDaddy.  I&#8217;ve had many issues with having the domain and the hosting plan under two different accounts at GoDaddy/Google.  Live and learn&#8230;</p>

<p>At the end of this tunnel, however, I&#8217;ll have several new notches in my belt and will be ready to confidently take on your website.</p>

<p>You have a website, right?</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/06/wakarusa" title="Permalink">On Wakarusa</a></h2>
		<p>&#8216;Twas an interesting time. Some backstory:</p>

<p>The Wakarusa festival has been going on for 5 years now (or something like that).  They experienced great success at the previous site of the festival in Lawrence, Kansas.  The only problem with the site was that it was held at a state park there, which gave local AND federal law enforcement free reign to be a real pain in the ass.  Lots of people got busted pretty much every year.  It was kind of a bad scene in amidst all the fun and great bands and good beer and 20k or so people that came.  We started doing it the second year, which must&#8217;ve been the year that the promoters, both independent and corporate, decided to make a push toward making it a big festival.  We&#8217;d never even heard of it before we booked it and all of a sudden String Cheese is on there and Wilco.  Cool.  Wilco was awesome - it was the Ghost is Born tour.  Anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>Due to such monumental hassles from the law, they finally decided to find a new site.  They uprooted the festival and moved it to Arkansas - not their Kansas - to a giant farm out in the Ozarks.  The guy that owns the place is named Dewey.  He&#8217;s an all around cool guy and he has a perfect place for holding a giant festival, complete with giant stage and all.</p>

<p>The first thing that I noticed was the lack of beer.  Well, not exactly, but the keg beer was Miller High Life, which I can be all about sometimes, but usually not for an entire weekend.  That was really the only bummer of the entire festival.  The second thing I noticed was how much nicer the weather was than it ever was in Kansas.  It was usually brutally hot at the old site, but up in the Ozarks it was cool and clear all weekend.  Our set on Thursday night went very well despite some technical mishaps in front of Carbone.  I personally kinda like it when his gear malfunctions because he inevitably plays his ass off like he&#8217;s trying to prove something, so no problem there.  The only thing was that for 15 agonizing minutes when we should&#8217;ve been starting our set, there were a couple thousand people watching Tim have a hard time with his gear.  For those of you that were at DelFest, yes we need some stage help.  We know.</p>

<p>One thing that I really noticed at this festival was the near-perfect timing of the stages.  Everything was timed to have traffic move from here to here to here like a ballet.  The walk from big stage to big stage was a lot shorter than the mile or so at the old festival site.  Camping was right there.</p>

<p>One other thing that I noticed was the huge preponderance of really young, wookie kids.  I think that just means that I&#8217;m getting older because at one point I remember thinking that most of these kids were probably in middle school when Phish broke up the last time.  Young.  There were some young kids there, but it didn&#8217;t have the family vibe like DelFest or High Sierra do.  Then I started pondering the sociological aspects of the festival scene in America and it&#8217;s coincidence with Phish taking a break.  The rise of the big corporate-sponsored festival happened more or less when Phish split, which left legions of summertime revelers with no Phish show to follow.  Enter the big music festival and presto.  I&#8217;m not sure about the economics of throwing a large festival like that, it&#8217;s probably just dicey on a larger scale than a smaller family festival, but I think that corporate sponsorship probably helped to cushion the stress of making sure you brought enough people to the fest to pay the bands.  Couple a deep recession leading to corporate festival sponsorship drying up and people having less available income with f-ing Phish going back on the road and I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s probably going to be a rough summer for festival promoters.  Langerado already tanked.  Bonnaroo this weekend has Bruce Springsteen for a headliner (I can&#8217;t fathom how the promoters of that one think that spending that much money on an artist like him is going to be worth it), so it should be interesting to see how that goes.</p>

<p>Conversely, it seems like a perfect time to be a club band.  It&#8217;s not that much money to spend to go to a show, especially compared with a vacation or a festival.  Ahh, the music biz.</p>

<p>Musical highlights :</p>

<p>Sly and Robbie.  The real deal.  Matisyahu went on after them, which must&#8217;ve been rough for him.</p>

<p>Split Lip Rayfield, of course.  &#8221;I drove that car for nearly two years, i even drove it on LSD&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>New Mastersounds.  Yes, they are as good as everyone says.  Can&#8217;t lose with british accents, either.</p>

		<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not a fan of Flash.  I&#8217;m not sure why except that I think it&#8217;s kinda like the B3 organ for me.  It&#8217;s great when someone uses it tastefully, but I&#8217;ve heard so many bands/albums misusing the B3 that it&#8217;s kinda ruined for me.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/05/ibd-manifesto" title="Permalink">ibD Manifesto</a></h2>
		<p class='note'>Disclaimer(s) : I will me using the terms "we" and "us" and "our" to refer alternately to my band <a href='railroadearth.com'>Railroad Earth</a>, and to my colleagues in the jamband scene without differentiating every time which I'm talking about. You'll just have to figure it out. Hope it's not too confusing.</p>
<p>This began as an email to a Rails developer that I&#8217;d been conversing with. He brought up the Digg Trent Reznor interview. After the first bit my response became more like a blog post. So I&#8217;m posting. <p style='text-align: center;'>----------------------------</p></p>
<span class='drop_cap'>I</span>
<p>Where we&#8217;re going to succeed is here : we aren&#8217;t just selling music. We have a huge fanbase that is rabid about supporting us whenever they can and coming to as many shows as possible and spreading the word about us far and wide because we&#8217;re where the party is. We&#8217;re the ultimate grassroots marketing test for web 2.0. Even String Cheese (and their business model) came along before Facebook, etc. Our fans buy our T-shirts and our music because they were probably at the show and they want a piece of that, and if they weren&#8217;t at the show, they want it for the collection. We draw more people to any given show in any given town than 9 out of 10 people you see on late night TV. But noone knows how to market us because we&#8217;re older or we&#8217;re not very good looking so therefore we don&#8217;t fit into the nice little mold that is the only thing most people in the PR or record label end of the biz know. Therefore, the reason we do 1500 people in Denver (for instance) with virtually no press or airplay at all is word of mouth, because we&#8217;re where the party is. After the first 3 pages of Tribes, I started to put some pieces together.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where I come in. I am not rich. I am not a label suit. I am not some manager trying to sell your band. I&#8217;m not some software geek. I&#8217;m just Grubb, the bass player from RRE that knows a lot people up and down and side to side in the jamband world. There is a huge amount of business going on here that hardly anyone pays any attention to unless it happens to be Bonnaroo weekend. As excited as the marketing world is about Twitter and Facebook, nobody over here really seems to get it. They do in a sense, but step number one, their websites - the first exposure to new fans for virtually all of us - look like shit, don&#8217;t relay information, don&#8217;t pull people in, don&#8217;t look professional, don&#8217;t give anyone a sense of who the band is or why they should be interested. I propose that if we, as a unit, started getting a lot more active about using the means available to us, and applying some dead-simple marketing initiative to our individual and collective web presence, we could start that populist movement this summer and put the last nails in the coffin of the <a href='http://www.wmg.com/'>crap-spewing</a>, <a href='http://www.riaa.com/'>download-suing</a> <a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/'>dinosaur</a> that is the gasping, wheezing remnants of the major label/print media system.&lt;/span&gt;</p>

<p>This is where the idea for the website/mobile app framework came from. It&#8217;s not complicated or original. There are competitors already out there. See <a href='http://www.kyte.com/platform/pg/kyte_iphone_apps_framework'>kyte.com</a> for the iPhone app framework, but they don&#8217;t get it either. Their product is kinda ugly to my eye, and they&#8217;re apparently only concerned with selling it to labels for their puppets (Soulja Boy, All American Rejects) to have. A few bands have gone on their own and developed an app (Death Cab, PUSA, Trent), but what bands in this end of the biz have the resources to do that? None apparently, and it&#8217;s a pity. It&#8217;s a pity because our fans travel incessantly to see us and lots of them have iPhones now. The Model/Controller end of every app built upon such a framework could stay exactly the same, and the View could stay largely the same for each bands&#8217; app. The possibilities are absolutely unlimited for the cool stuff you could put in there that would be of use to a traveling music fan&#8230;</p>

<p>Of course, only a relatively small portion of the world has a smartphone at this time, but virtually everyone has internet access. A huge swath of our fans are first exposed to us and our music via our websites. Our (rre&#8217;s) website is okay, but not too spectacular visually, not too easy to navigate, and the eCommerce part of it is so outdated and difficult to use that it might as well not be there. Somehow we still manage to sell stuff through our website, which is a testament to our fans&#8217; determination to help support us. I suspect that many bands have a similar experience. They have merch there, but take a look at a well done eCommerce site, and there&#8217;s no comparison. They need help. There&#8217;s no reason to not have a better machine in place. One that&#8217;s easy to use. One that&#8217;s easy to find. One that integrates cleanly with the mobile app. I think I found the answer this weekend.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/05/seo-in-action" title="Permalink">SEO in action</a></h2>
		<p>So an interesting thing happened yesterday.  I have this cool plug-in installed on this blog.  It&#8217;s called StatPress, and it all but lets me look back through your screen at you.  It logs all traffic to this blog, IP addresses, referring links, what OS and browser you&#8217;re using, and what search term you entered into Google to find my blog.  If this is creepy to you, you should know that every time you&#8217;re on the internet you are broadcasting this info with every single click of the mouse.  It&#8217;s not that big of a deal.  I don&#8217;t know who you are, just what ISP you use and in what general area of the world you live.  I know that there&#8217;s a 6 to 1 chance that you&#8217;re reading this on a computer that has Windows XP on it.  I know that you are most likely browsing on Firefox 3, and that if it&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s IE7, and if it&#8217;s not that, then you&#8217;re probably on an iPhone.  Good thing I installed that mobile plug in&#8230;</p>

<p>This is all just info that entertains my analytical mind while sitting in a tour bus on the way to DelFest.  Usually when I throw up a new post there&#8217;s a little blip in traffic unless I post a link on Facebook, in which case there&#8217;s usually a big blip.  I try to save those for the really good ones.  The ones like &#8221;<a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/blog/?p=157'>Coolest iPhone App Ever</a>&#8221;.  The act of titling that post that way was an unwitting example of what the social marketing dorks, I mean cool people, call Search Engine Optimization, or SEO.  It didn&#8217;t occur to me until a few days later when someone in France googled SimpleMindsXpress, and amazingly my blog post was the first one that popped up.  On the French Google.  The internet is weird.</p>

<p>So, briefly, how Google Works&#8230;</p>

<p>Google is constantly scanning more or less the entire internet to add pages to it&#8217;s humongous database of searchable content.  The automated robot that does this scanning is called a &#8220;Spider&#8221;.  The Google Spider is my blogs most frequent visitor.  It&#8217;s already been here 9 times today, and just fetches a blog post at random as far as I can tell.  It scans the content toward the top of the blog post and then moves on.  It adds that content to it&#8217;s database and then that post is searchable.  Google weights pages that have more links <strong>to</strong> them as being more important than others that show up with the same search terms with fewer links to them.  I once read hyperlinks as being described as the &#8220;currency&#8221; of the internet.  Makes sense if you consider that the more links a particular page has pointed at it, the more wealthy it&#8217;s likely to be in terms of traffic, especially search traffic.  Why this is important to you and your band is that you better put the pertinent info that you want Google to notice toward the top of the page.  If you don&#8217;t have the Page Title/Info/Author metadata correctly filled in (ask your web guy, or better yet, <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/'>ask me</a>), you&#8217;re making yourself harder to find.</p>

<p>So anyway, yesterday some marketing guy in South Carolina went and googled up &#8220;coolest buiness related iPhone apps (sic)&#8221;.  Somehow, misspelling business made my blog post show up in the top ten list of results.  I didn&#8217;t misspell business in my blog post.  I don&#8217;t know.  But anyway, this guy hops on Twitter and <a href='http://twitter.com/wscottbrandon/status/1871251133'>links to my blog post</a>.  I get on StatPress a couple hours later and notice a spike in traffic to that post.  So I dig a little deeper and notice the referring link to this guy&#8217;s Twitter update, and the beauty and utility of SEO becomes a factor in my life for the first time.  I&#8217;ve only been blogging since February, and I&#8217;m writing this most for my own edification and partly for my friends and associates.  After yesterdays incident it occurred to me that I should probably put my email address on here somewhere.  So I did.  And now my brain is humming along about how and why SEO is an important thing to you and me.  Oh, and trying not to put an obnoxious amount of hyperlinks into this post.</p>

<p>Now how can I get this <a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=johnny+grubb'>other Johnny Grubb</a> to let me in the top ten.  Is that Carly Simon I hear?</p>

		<p>I was always more of a Miles Davis man.  I guess what I&#8217;m comparing it to is perhaps if someone were a Coltrane man.  I&#8217;m not sure why you need to pick one or the other, hell you could like them both as much as you want, it&#8217;s just that Miles&#8217; style always spoke to me so much more.  His was so understated whereas the style that Coltrane made famous was one that seems to be embraced and expounded upon by many many legions of jambands, rock bands, jazz fusion bands, etc.  Anyone that really liked a long jam with sheets and sheets of notes from the soloist.  Not that Miles wasn&#8217;t into big long jams either, but the period of his that is my favorite is somewhere between 1958 and 1965&#8230;</p>

<p>1958 actually saw him in a marvelous quartet with the aforementioned Mr. John Coltrane.  Personally this is my favorite period of either artist.  My all time favorite jazz record is one called &#8220;Relaxin with the Miles Davis Quintet&#8221;.  There&#8217;s a tune on there called &#8220;You&#8217;re My Everything&#8221; that is one of the most beautiful things I&#8217;ve ever heard.  The piano player, Red Garland, starts the tune after Miles calls it (this is one of the four albums that Miles cut on the same day, there&#8217;s lots of rough edges which is part of what I love about it.  They keep a lot of the studio chatter on the master).  Miles cuts him off and tells him to play it completely differently, which Red does with hardly a pause.  It&#8217;s heartbreaking.  Coltrane&#8217;s solo still gives me goosebumps after listening to this album for almost 15 years now.</p>

<p>Another amazing Coltrane solo is his from &#8220;Blue on Green&#8221; from Kind of Blue.  I&#8217;m not a guy who ever sat around and really got off on other people&#8217;s solos, but these two are very much worth checking out if you don&#8217;t already own the recordings.</p>

<p>1965 saw Miles putting together his second &#8220;great&#8221; quintet.  This is the one with a young Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter on the bass, Wayne Shorter on the sax and an 18 year old Tony Williams on the kit.  My personal favorite tune of theirs is called &#8220;Madness&#8221; from the album Nefertiti.  Miles was starting to get more than a little out there by this point.  He was breaking down the traditional walls of form that he&#8217;d begun taking out with Kind of Blue.   The level of talent and drive of this quintet took it way beyond where he was able to go with Cannonball and Bill Evans.  I&#8217;m not really sure there is a form to the tune Madness, but it&#8217;s worth a listen.  I never consciously realized this in college, or even until recently, but Tony Williams doesn&#8217;t touch a damn thing on his kit except the ride cymbal for the entire tune.  If any jazz student out there wants to know what it sounds like to &#8220;swing&#8221;, start here.  Most of the tune after the head is Tony&#8217;s ride and Ron Carter&#8217;s bass, swinging like a wrecking ball.  The solos are nice, but what really kills me about how powerful this tune is is all the space, and how ballsy it is to leave so much of it there.  Believe me, leaving space is way harder than filling it up, but it <strong>always</strong> leaves the listener more satisfied.  Hearing this tune again this morning for the first time in a while reminds me of that and makes me wonder if I&#8217;m not in the wrong band sometimes&#8230;</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s kinda difficult.  I feel bad for not really having much to say, but I&#8217;ve been pondering (probably excessively) over what direction it should really take.</p>

<p>My good buddy Anders, of Greensky fame and fortune, let me know that he checks it out from time to time.  &#8221;Some of it&#8217;s really technical&#8221;, he says.  Stacy says the same thing. &#8220;but then occasionally you&#8217;ll write something&#8221; pertinent.  So, I&#8217;ve been pondering how to take it and relate it maybe to something else that makes the dryness of database theory a bit more palatable.</p>

<p>For instance, my post a while back about &#8220;Development Platforms&#8221;.  That was a bunch of tripe that would only make sense if you were already a propellerhead.  What I should&#8217;ve said was something like this:</p>

<p>A development platform, and choosing one to develop on, is sort of like deciding what style of music you want to play.  If you really like the blues, you don&#8217;t have to invent the blues.  Someone already did that and all you need to do is write some lyrics for your song, because the same 12 bar form has been there for decades now.  That could be iPhone development.  You want to build cool websites?  The AABA form has been used to great effect to write countless jazz tunes since the 20s.  All you need to do is pick a key and make up a progression.  May I suggest rhythm changes?  Ruby on Rails, well that&#8217;d probably be the blues since there&#8217;s the least amount of configuring to do before you get to the creative part.</p>

<p>Make more sense?  My other buddy Jay (of Donna the Buffalo fame and fortune)  has a great analogy for database theory that I&#8217;ll get to when I have a chance.  I have way more free time on the road than at home these days.  See y&#8217;all later&#8230;</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/04/chapter-4-api" title="Permalink">Chapter 4 - The API</a></h2>
		<p>Facebook made <a href='http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=225' title='FBDevLink' target='_blank'>this announcement yesterday</a> through the Developers section of their site:</p>
<blockquote>Today we are excited to announce an important step toward greater openness through Facebook Platform. For the first time, we're opening the core Facebook product experience -- the <a href='http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=57822962130'><em>stream</em></a> -- with the new Facebook Open Stream API.</blockquote>
<p>What this says to me is that Twitter is having a major impact on the evolution of the internet right now, namely in the heat they&#8217;re putting on Facebook to innovate.</p>

<p>Now, the close up view of Twitter and Facebook looks pretty similar. Facebook is a place where people can make their own little website and stash pictures there to show their friends, etc., but the real innovation of Facebook has been to tap into the collective ADD of humanity and provide a place where you can tell people what you&#8217;re doing and read about what they&#8217;re doing, in small chunks. Twitter is a place where you can tap into the collective ADD of humanity and tell people what you&#8217;re doing and read about what they&#8217;re doing in small chunks, but the real innovation of Twitter is their API.</p>

<p>An API (<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API'>Application Programming Interface</a>) is basically the software equivalent to a door into your application. The 3rd party developer is then able to write his own application that uses that door to do stuff with the application (or it&#8217;s data) on the other side. It&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s what takes your application from being more or less a mute, single-celled organism to one that all the sudden can speak with others and communicate. That&#8217;s why there are so many Twitter clients coming out all the time. Twitter on it&#8217;s own is cool, if a bit mundane, but that they&#8217;ve opened the system to others to make more fun/valuable for them is why they are changing the world right now.</p>

<p>Facebook is paying close attention. They&#8217;ve kept lean and innovative where MySpace went bloated and corporate, but they&#8217;ve always preferred the closed ecosystem approach. All those applications that people continually send you are cool and all, but they force the developer to work within the confines of FB rules if you want to interact with the stuff that&#8217;s going on within their walls. And there is an unfathomable amount of stuff going on within their walls. Think what you could do if you could break out all those people talking to each other, all those people posting photos, all those people connecting over similar interests or old school ties and start figuring out new ways to play with all that. The possibilities make Twitter look like a drop in the bucket&#8230;</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/04/coolest-iphone-app-ever" title="Permalink">Coolest iPhone App Ever.</a></h2>
		<p>So, as I mentioned in <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/blog/?p=33'>some other post</a>, after about my first hour or so playing with the iPhone, it came to me that this was a device that could help you get things done.  No more going to the computer, turning on the computer, waiting for it to boot up, etc., just to check my email?  A calendar that I always have in my pocket?  These were revelations to my unorganized old-self.  After the 2.0 update and the ability to add functionality to an already cool device was released, that&#8217;s when the real fun began.  I was on the bus yesterday and Stacy was reading the NY Times across from me, and there was that ad that Apple is running aimed toward small business owners.  One of the free apps that they displayed was called <a href='http://www.simpleapps.eu/simplemind/'>SimpleMindsXpress</a>, so I checked it out.  I cannot recommend an app more highly than this one.  Let me elaborate&#8230;</p>

<p>As you darn well know if you read this blog, I&#8217;ve recently undertaken the self-assigned role of Web Czar of my band.  Whilst pondering over all of the various aspects of what a band like mine needs to be on top of in terms of their web presence, I&#8217;ve often wished I were better about writing stuff down - organizational website overviews, flowcharts of how a shopping cart experience should be, etc.  I&#8217;m just not a pencil and paper guy.  Luckily, someone out there figured out a way to make it much more exciting to my brain!  And it was free!  So, here&#8217;s how I picture RRE&#8217;s overall web presence: <p style='text-align: center;'><img class='size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter' title='RRE Web Presence' src='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0919.JPG' height='189' alt='RRE Web Presence' width='472' /></p> <p style='text-align: left;'>So, great!  Now I can kind of get my head around it a little better.  I've broken it into 2 main categories (for my purposes.  Media/PR is going to be handled by the proper authorities), our official presence and the one that is probably going to be even more important overall, the Community.  They both involve using the various social networks, and in the free version you can't link a child category to 2 parent categories, so I just created Social Networks for both.  Now, zooming in a little closer, you can start to organize which social networks on which you want to keep track of your presence:</p> <p style='text-align: center;'><img class='size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter' title='Social Networks' src='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0918.JPG' height='140' alt='RRE Web Presence' width='350' /></p></p>

<p>and if you have a campaign specific to one of them, you can zoom in further.  BTW, the auto-spell checker on the iPhone automatically changes Twitter to Twitted (decidedly inconvenient these days), and there appears to be a bug in this app that won&#8217;t let you dismiss the &#8220;correct&#8221; word.  Annoying, but I guess nothing is perfect.  Now I&#8217;m going to turn my attention to the forthcoming fan site, which we will park at Railroadearth.net when all is said and done: <p style='text-align: center;'><img class='size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter' title='RRE.net' src='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0921.JPG' height='280' alt='RRE.net&quot;' width='420' /></p> <p style='text-align: left; '>And the next Railroadearth.com:</p> <p style='text-align: center;'><img class='size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter' title='RRE.com' src='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0923.JPG' height='250' alt='RRE.com' width='472' /></p></p>

<p>Or the RRE iPhone app: <p style='text-align: center;'><img class='size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter' title='RRE.com' src='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0924.JPG' height='150' alt='RRE iPhone' width='300' /></p> <p style='text-align: left; '>Holy crap!!!</p> <p style='text-align: left; ' /> <p style='text-align: left; '>So, in closing, in two hours on the bus yesterday I was pretty much able to sketch out just about every component of our entire online infrastructure, which as much or as little abstraction as I needed.  God bless America!</p> <p style='text-align: left; '>Edit: So last night's deep thought was that I completely forgot to even mention how it works.  They call these diagrams "Mind Maps", and when you create a new one, you start off with that central blue bubble.  If you want to add a category under that you just click the button.  A different colored bubble shows up that you then name with the category.  You can move them around and add new ones and cut old ones out.  For instance, here's the revised overall scheme, to which I added the iPhone app and just tightened everything up:</p> <p style='text-align: left; '><img class='aligncenter size-medium wp-image-310' title='RRE Web Revised' src='http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/photo-300x184.jpg' height='200' alt='RRE Web Revised' width='320' /></p></p>

		<p>Ahmad Jamal - The Awakening</p>

<p>The only version of Oliver Nelson&#8217;s &#8220;Stolen Moments&#8221; that might actually be better than the original. Several other outstanding renditions of great standards on there as well. A. Jobim&#8217;s &#8220;Wave&#8221; and H. Hancock&#8217;s &#8220;Dolphin Dance&#8221; are two of them. This is one of the first jazz albums I picked up in college, before I started playing jazz. When I took the jazz history class at ASU, I wrote a paper about it. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why none of these tunes follow the AABA form. My ears later got good enough to realize that they did, but that Jamal was throwing in these huge jammy vamps in between the sections. Great jazz album&#8230;</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/04/chapter-3-dev-platform" title="Permalink">Chapter3 - devPlatform</a></h2>
		<p>As in, what does that mean, anyway?  I&#8217;ll try and keep it short.</p>

<p>When I spoke of Ruby on Rails the other day as the &#8216;hotsh!t dev platform of the day&#8217;, I realized that it would need some clarification.  So let me clarify.</p>

<p>Coding pretty much anything is a massive, time consuming job.  That&#8217;s part of the reason that computer languages have evolved from 1s and 0s to Fortran to C to C++ to Java to Ruby: if you were to try and write the Twitter website in assembly language (binary), you&#8217;d be there coding for a very long time.  If you were to try and write Windows 7, you couldn&#8217;t do it.  Hell, they can barely do it now.</p>

<p>Man has devised a better way.  I wrote about some of it in the <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/blog/?p=92'><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Database post</span></a>.  He has set to automating as much of the menial, repetitive work as possible so that the developer may set his mind toward accomplishing other tasks, like the fun bits of the application.  In the case of iPhone development, Apple has created an environment in which to write the apps, <a href='http://developer.apple.com/TOOLS/xcode/'><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>X Code</span></a>.  X Code is itself an application that runs on your Mac just like any other application.  The nice thing about X Code is that Apple designed it specifically for the purposes of making applications for Macs and iPhones.</p>

<p>History lesson, culled mostly from the Mac dev bible, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS-3rd/dp/0321503619/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1239052561&amp;sr=1-1'><em><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</span></em></a>:</p>

<p>Apple computers was started years ago in a garage by two guys named Steve.  They&#8217;re both very famous now, Steve W perhaps <em>slightly</em> less so.  The two guys named Steve decided that since they were both programmers and engineers, that perhaps they should hire a CEO type to help them with their rapidly growing company.  CEO guy came in and moved Steve J to some kind of powerless position in the company, so he split.  He started another company called NeXT.  They never did anything commercially successful, but they did develop an operating system and a platform for writing applications - one that started with a fairly significant library of code already put together to make the developers job that much quicker.  At some point, Apple was not doing well financially or otherwise and Microsoft came in and basically gave them a lifeline.  This was in the 90s.  Steve J at that point was an intensely innovative failure.  Funny, huh?</p>

<p>Around this time Apple decided to buy NeXT computers along with the Operating System that they had developed.  Steve J was brought back as an advisor for a little bit before becoming CEO within a year.  The NeXT OS eventually became Mac OS X, which eventually became the iPhone OS.  The point is that even though the iPhone has only been around for less than 2 years now, the developmental lead-up took decades.  During that time, various developers decided that they would put together &#8216;libraries&#8217; of code for making Macintosh applications and save themselves the time of having to rewrite all this code that&#8217;s essentially &#8220;boilerplate&#8221;, meaning the same in every app, there to provide low level functionality that the end user never encounters and is very rarely altered even by the developer though widely varying apps are coming out the other end.  Every language that&#8217;s in any kind of wide use has it&#8217;s own set of libraries, there to provide standard functionality for the programmer and standard sets of instructions for the computer to execute when certain functions are called within the app.</p>

<p>Okay, sorry.  There&#8217;s a lot in there that I wouldn&#8217;t have understood 9 months ago, so let me break it down for you.</p>

<p>When you tell X Code to start a new project, it asks you what kind of project you&#8217;d like to start.  It gives you the options of a couple of different layouts of iPhone apps.  Perhaps you&#8217;d care to build a navigation-based application.  That&#8217;s when you use buttons to navigate through different tables of data and settings.  The Setting app on your (or your friends&#8217;) iPhone is an example of a navigation-based app.  Maybe today you&#8217;d like a tab-bar based app.  This is like the iPod app on the iPhone.  You have a menu of a few pages at the bottom of the screen that take you to different pages in the app.  Maybe you just want a blank window because you&#8217;re building a game that your crew can play in the bus between gigs.  Anyway, after you decide that, it puts together the skeleton of your application with a bunch of different chunks of code that every single app is going to need to run.  The developer then fills out the skeleton and a newborn baby application is brought into the world.  Apple calls their development framework Cocoa, and for iPhone it&#8217;s Cocoa Touch.  Cocoa is just a collection of pre-compiled libraries of code lashed together to help make the dev process that much easier.  Cocoa has a name, so it seems like it should be a physical thing.  It&#8217;s not.  This has been one of the hardest parts about this process to get my head around.  It&#8217;s a bunch of code that someone else already wrote so that you don&#8217;t have to.</p>

<p>Ruby on Rails is also a framework.  A big part of writing Rails apps is using a command called &#8216;script&#8217;.  You call a script command to help you build these chunks of code, and the script automatically does a LOT of the tedious work for you.  I love this, because I don&#8217;t have nearly the experience to write something from the ground up, and that sounds like a lot of wasted time besides.  Tweaking the generated code is then how the developer builds his app.  Brilliant.  This is what a development platform is.  This is why most Mac applications have that &#8220;Mac-y&#8221; look and feel.  This is why all these New-Web social networking sites have a that sorta clean, modern look and feel, and why so many of them employ Google maps as well as each other in their functionality.</p>

<p>Once you get your head around which platform you want to develop on (I&#8217;m thinking Rails to learn), then you can start learning your way around the API, which is where the real fun begins.  I&#8217;m not there yet, but will try to remember to link there when I am.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/04/file-under-random-memory" title="Permalink">file.under=>RandomMemory</a></h2>
		<p>I went to school in Boone, North Carolina at Appalachian State University. When I picture heaven in my head, it looks more or less like what I remember the drive from Banner Elk to Boone along 105 looking like - Grandfather Mountain, the old Gold Mine tourist joint in Foscoe, Hawk's Nest ski area where I used to be a lift operator, that sandwich place on the corner of the turn to Valle Cruces, the leaves in the fall, the walk up Howard's Knob, hiking up Table Rock in the middle of the night to see the most beautiful sunrise a few hours later. I get goosebumps thinking about it.</p><p>For some reason I've been thinking about that drive a lot the past two days. I wonder what it looks like now. There used to be this rock quarry at the top of the hill as you were leaving Boone toward Foscoe, at the corner of the 105 bypass. I was cleaning up my yard this week and I remembered driving past that quarry probably 8 or 9 years ago. This was just as I was getting into DJing in college. I didn't go to Phish shows in college like all of my friends did. The String Cheese Incident was just starting to get really big about the time that I graduated. Instead I got into the whole Electronic/DJ/Rave scene in the late 90s. This was before kids started sneaking out of the house and getting themselves killed ingesting drugs meant to put Fido to sleep at the vet, in a golden year-long period where the rave scene in NC was exactly where I wanted to be. I spent my time driving to big parties all over the SE to go see DJ Icey, Dieselboy, Sasha and John Digweed, Jimmy Van M, Simply Jeff, Scott and Robbie Hardkiss, DJ Keoki, Donald Glaude, DJ Dara...</p><p>I went to this one party in my hometown of ATL one time. The headliners were Simply Jeff and DJ Icey and Dieselboy. There was a point earlier in the night where I was dancing my ass off and I noticed that there was this circle around me of people watching. It was weird because I wasn't paying any attention to anything other than the basslines coming out of the system courtesy of Mr. Icey. I still remember this one record he played that night - the vocal hook was "can you feel the BASS", and when the record said 'bass' there was this note that came out of the subs that can't be related verbally. It shook the world. It made my hair stand up. It made the entire party, all 5000 of us, stop dancing and look around at each other. Yes, we could feel the bass. Oh my God, could we feel it...</p><p>Later in the night I found myself up on this stairway platform looking out at the whole crowd rippling like a flag blowing in the breeze. I came down the stairs and some girl walks by with a backpack full of glowsticks. I said it was the late 90s, didn't I? I guess this girl was part of what I now know as the 'ambiance crew'. I'd never seen her before, but she walks by me and pulls out a glowstick and cracks it open and hands it to me. I still have that glowstick. That glowstick was the light bulb that went on in my head at the moment that I looked around and noticed 5000 people dancing in unison to 1 guy's music. 1 guy hidden in some corner of that place had this entire party under his spell. 1 guy was responsible for guiding this entire party and making them get down like they'd never gotten down before in their lives. That's was the moment I knew that I needed to get a pair of turntables and start figuring this thing out.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/04/chapter2-databases" title="Permalink">Chapter2 - Databases</a></h2>
		<p>This part of the blog is going to be tough to write.  Not because I don&#8217;t have much to say on the topic, but because I have frequent pangs of &#8220;dude, you don&#8217;t really know anything about any of this stuff&#8221;.  Then the other side of my brain speaks up. &#8220;Dude, it&#8217;s cool.  They know you&#8217;re not a professor.  That&#8217;s the point of this whole thing, right?  If someone wants hard facts and a professionally written tutorial on computer science, they&#8217;d probably go somewhere else.  If they&#8217;re here, they&#8217;re either a friend or an understanding onlooker, and either way they&#8217;re probably well aware that you&#8217;re just a bass player.  Nobody really expects that much from the bass player.&#8221;  So, I&#8217;m on I 70 headed east across Kansas after selling the <em>shit </em>out of the Ogden theater this weekend.</p>

<p>And now, my initial impressions on the theory and practice of the database.</p>

<p>What the hell is a database?  Being a visual kind of thinker, I&#8217;ve been trying to come up with some sort of relatable analogy to help myself understand exactly what it is.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a series of tables, populated with data, and the tables relate to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Okay.  What do you do with it?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, once you have the data in your database, you can run queries on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That sounds like a lot of fun!  But what the hell does that mean?</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, queries are like a request that you make.  Say you have a database that&#8217;s populated with every song that RRE has ever played at every show in every venue.  If you wanted to know what you played at a given venue the previous time that you were there, then you could query the database to give you the set list from that show.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, but say you wanted to know how many times you&#8217;ve played Mighty River.  You could query the same database and get an answer on that, too.  Say you wanted to know the venues where you played it.  You could query that, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Okay, I get it.  So a database is kind of like a big spreadsheet?</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of, but not really.  You see a spreadsheet is basically one big monolithic sheet that stores your data in rows and columns; like a database, but a database is made up of many of those sheets, and the collection of those sheets and the way that they relate to each other, and the queries that you can then make of the data is what makes it a more useful tool than just a big sheet with some numbers on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Okay.  So, how about an example?</p>

<p>For this, we shall turn to the web.  Actually, never mind because this is a blog which means that you don&#8217;t need to turn at all.  Let&#8217;s press Ctrl-T and get a fresh tab going in your browser and go on over to <a href='http://amazon.com'>Amazon</a>.  Mac users have the option of Cmd-clicking the link to open in a new browser tab, so you don&#8217;t have to navigate away from me.</p>

<p>Okay.  You see all that stuff on the page?  Just about everything there is stored in a big-ass database - all the text, all the ads, all the pictures.  Now, why is this important?  For that, we&#8217;ll turn to my bookshelf and it&#8217;s copy of <em>The Complete and Unabridged History of The Internet</em>.  I see here in chapter two after all this non-sense about universities and the DoD that once upon a time there was no such thing as the World Wide Web.  I&#8217;ll skip to the part where then there was a WWW.  The first websites on the newborn baby web were mostly authored in straight HTML, an interpreted language used to help your computer assemble some data on the other end into a web page.  A skilled HTML coder can control every single element on the page that&#8217;s being displayed down to the very pixel (until it&#8217;s opened in another browser, but that&#8217;s another chapter).  The HTML basically tells your browser what text to display, how to format it, what the background color ought to be, where to place the pictures and to what they should link.  This is understandably tedious and time consuming work, but you gotta do it if you want your website to look right.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, websites started getting much more complex.  Some genius decided to make a big online store where you could get pretty much anything, from books to socks to computers to whatever.  Now, imagine if you will, the task of hand coding every page.  For every item and every view and every picture and every review there was some army of poor bastards on the other end furiously coding away to keep up with the inflow of new inventory/users/reviews.  I recently read about some guy who worked for an online newspaper, and he supposedly spent 14 hours a day coding HTML for the site before he figured out that there was a better way to get your steady flow of content up there.</p>

<p>The answer lies in scripting language and a database.</p>

<p>A scripting language is basically the same thing as an interpreted language in as much as it&#8217;s not compiled, or even thought of until &#8220;runtime&#8221;.  At runtime, the computer gives instructions to something, probably your browser, which then passes the request along to the code.  It&#8217;s at that time (runtime) that the code is crunched into the binary code that your computer can actually do something with on the processor level.  This is hyper-simplified.</p>

<p>What this means in the Amazon example is that instead of hand-coding every page, why not just build a template that gets populated with the data that&#8217;s requested at the time?  Then you don&#8217;t have to rebuild the wheel every single time a page request is made.  Well, how do you build a template?  With a scripting language, of course!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll just cut to the bird-eye view.  When you go to Amazon, and it knows that it&#8217;s you, and it spits out all that stuff that you should buy based on past purchases, that&#8217;s because all of that info is stored in a database.  When you click on an item and go to that items page, and the page looks just like the last one, that&#8217;s because all that info is stored in a database.  There&#8217;s a table in there for every one of you, and for every item on the site.  The table for you has all of your info in it, including past purchases, addresses, billing info, etc.  The table for each item has the description, pictures, reviews, links, etc.</p>

<p>The point is that each of these tables is filled out in a standard way with all of their pertinent data.  Why this is cool is that some automated process can then do something with it, like fill out a web page, or display your customer profile.  The scripting language is what automates the process.  It provides the instructions for the web server on the other end of your computer to &#8220;dynamically&#8221; make up the HTML needed to display the pictures and profile info and whatever else in a cohesive way across the entire website.  Dynamically means that you don&#8217;t need an army of HTMLers because the computer is writing the HTML at the time of the page request. Every different kind of page on the site (say reviews vs. the home page) has it&#8217;s own scripted template that&#8217;s called up when the appropriate request is made. Kinda cool, no?</p>

<p>So, a database is somewhere between MS Excel and that big Tupperware bin where you keep all your summer clothes.  We&#8217;ll dive into the beauty of doing things this way later.</p>

<p>A few database driven websites:</p>
<a href='http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3ARailroadEarth&amp;sort=-date'>Archive.org</a><a href='http://twitter.com'>Twitter</a><a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/blog'>This blog</a><a href='http://messageboard.tapeop.com/index.php?sid=d5ce53c0f1b60db5b462e65e841b6cfa'>Any message forum</a>
<p>Extra credit : Start paying attention to URLs, especially whenever the letters .php are used.  PHP is a very widely used scripting language for making database driven websites, and if .php is included somewhere on your address bar, you&#8217;re looking at data that&#8217;s stored in a database.</p>

		<p>It occurred to me last night during the show (where I do all of my best thinking) that of all of the thousands of websites that I&#8217;ve pored over in this quest, of all the books that I&#8217;ve perused, of all the tutorials that I&#8217;ve read and followed through, the one thing that was missing was the square one explanation of what the hell we&#8217;re doing here in the first place. Everything I&#8217;ve read so far assumes some sort of foreknowledge or education to prepare oneself for the task of learning software development. I have no such education. A few very basic concepts have to be put into place before one can train oneself to think like a computer (or more likely, to train your computer to think like you).<div><br /></div><div>As I've said before, software dev is a new thing for me, so if anyone has any corrections or additions to anything I write, <b>please</b> send them to me.  I am now attempting to write the complete and utter morons guide to learning software development.  I want to be factually correct, of course.  And without further adieu..</div></p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/03/chapter1a" title="Permalink">chapter1a</a></h2>
		<strong>Quick bio - The difference between</strong>
<p>As in, the difference between your brain and your computers CPU. The difference between how you think and speak and interact, and how your computer does. The difference between languages, be they interpreted or compiled, object oriented or procedural. This first chapter will hopefully assist in the process of the first few days after the moment where it first occurs to you that you want to learn how to develop software, be they games or business or iPhone apps. The real difference for me was the the one between what I thought the process was going to be and what it&#8217;s actually turned out to be.</p>

<p>The moment occurred for me in a car. I had bought an iPhone a few months after it first came out. It was the first such early adopter move that I&#8217;d made, technologically speaking. I knew as soon as I started screwing around with it that this was a tool that could really help you get your life organized, something that I&#8217;d managed to get around doing for the previous 30 years. All of the built in applications that Apple provided for their first tier of users were most helpful in that task - email everywhere, calendar, internet, maps, oh yeah, and a phone. The real fun didn&#8217;t begin for me until they (Apple) released the 2.0 software update. This was the update that heralded the opening of the AppStore, where there were now hundreds of apps available from 3rd party developers that could extend the usefulness of your phone. Anyway, to make a long story no less long, the first long car ride I took after updating my phone was the one where the <em>real</em> potential of mobile computing dawned on me.</p>

<p>I came home that weekend determined to figure out what it would take to learn the art and craft of building my own applications, as this was clearly a vast and uncharted territory for creative people to make things that could affect the lives of huge numbers of people (and maybe even make a living doing it).</p>

<p>I got home that week and started Googling. A search on Computer Programming turned up a mountain of information that was so staggeringly huge as to be almost useless. I did learn a few things - Wikipedia can be your best friend; there are many different ways to program computers; there are endless amounts of information on programming computers, most of it written by computer programmers with no conversational or literary ability whatsoever.</p>

<p>I was able to discern a few important pieces, however. One was something called &#8220;compilation&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t sure what this was or why it was important, but hey. Another was that if you&#8217;re going to develop software, and you&#8217;re used to working in a more or less standard Windows environment, you&#8217;re in for a ride. Another was that there was something called Object Oriented programming, that supposedly is some kind of elevated way to program. iPhone apps are written in an OO manner. Oh, and if you really want to develop apps for the iPhone, you have to buy a Mac. That&#8217;s some clever marketing, and the push over the cliff that I&#8217;d been waiting for for years. The bonus was that once you bought the Mac, all of the tools to develop apps, as well as an enormous user community was there to help, for free. Step 1.</p>

		<p>Oh, yeah&#8230; The Holy frickin Grail. The MVC framework that&#8217;s sweeping the land fell under my text editor yesterday. <div><br /></div><div>I hacked my way into Ruby on Rails.  </div><div><br /></div><div>I built a website yesterday in two hours that does more than anything I've done in the last nine months.  Granted, it doesn't look that great, but it's functional.  Also granted, it took me nine months to put the conceptual pieces together, and to find the technical resources to do something with the RoR framework that I downloaded 6 weeks ago, and to figure out how to install all manner of seriously deep Unix command line shit, but so help me, it's an exhilarating feeling.</div><div><br /></div><div>Okay, so RoR isn't the Holy Grail, iPhone apps are, for me.  iPhone apps are written in a language that's not Ruby, but the MVC architecture is the same.  What I'm <i>hoping</i> that this means is that all this cool stuff that I'm learning about building Ruby stuff will translate nicely to building Obj-C stuff.  The work that I've done over the past 2 weeks with PHP was heavily informed by the one class I took on straight C, so I'm optimistic.  </div><div><br /></div><div>I'm in Davenport IA right now.

		<h2><a href="/2009/03/standing-waves" title="Permalink">standingWaves</a></h2>
		<p>Sitting here in the surprisingly nice Richmond VA airport, so I thought I&#8217;d check in. Cool cabby on the ride here. He saw my big PHP book and started asking me about what I was doing, so that pretty much filled up the 20 minute cab ride. <div><br /></div><div>Last night's show was kinda just alright for me, personally.  It's funny because Phil and Stacy both thought it was the best show of the weekend.  It's just goes to show, you never know.  I've learned through the years (you never let me down..) that I have absolutely the most subjective opinion about the quality of any given show of anyone in the listening world.  It's the double edge sword that keeps us from putting out more LiveDownloads.  Typically for me, the quality of the experience that I have on any given night is directly proportional to the frequency distribution between 40 and 150 Hz in the location on the stage at which I'm standing.  That's a pretty specific requirement, but last night it just wasn't that happening.  The theater we were playing in last night was Very Big.  Very Big means a lot of air that you have to get moving before the entire room starts to feel right, which is what makes it sound good between 40-150 Hz wherever I am on stage.  </div><div><br /></div><div>I suppose that we probably wouldn't be as subject to the peculiarities of a given rooms acoustics if we were a more electric band.  Let's just take my bass for example.  My bass is a giant wood box that's designed to resonate.  I stand next to a drum set.  If you were to solo up the signal from my DI during a show and listen to what is making my bass resonate, you'd hear the notes I'm playing, but also the kick drum loud and clear.  You hear a good bit of fiddle, or God forbid the electric guitar, and the rest of the stage, muffled.  This makes my bass essentially the biggest microphone on the stage, with a frequency response that tapers off at about 100 Hz.</div><div><br /></div><div>What this means to me is that if the room is shaped just so, and you never know until you start playing, there's the possibility of a 'standing wave' on certain notes.  A standing wave is one that has a wavelength that's some multiple of the dimensions of the stage we're playing.  Suppose I play an open D.  Suppose that D vibrates at a frequency of 65 Hz.  That means that 65 times every second that string is going to return to more or less the same place in space on my bass (nice).  While that string is vibrating it's sending a signal to my amp and to Mikey out in front.  That string is going to cause air to be pushed out of the speakers 65 times a second.  The air being pushed out of those speakers is going to travel at the speed of sound and bounce off of hard surfaces and dancing bodies alike.  The hard surfaces reflect the sound much better, and those soundwaves bounce off and travel back toward me.  Meanwhile, other soundwaves have been continuing to come out of my amp and the PA.  If the note that I'm playing at the time lines up in a certain reinforcing way with the note that's bouncing back toward me from the wall and the PA, you get a standing wave.  That's when feedback begins, and my night starts to go downhill.</div><div><br /></div><div>Other nights it's the exact opposite, and the note that's bouncing off the wall is totally out of sync with the note that I'm playing at the time.  That's when you get 'phase cancellation', which means that the soundwaves are canceling each other out.  That's even worse than a standing wave for me, because then there's really no balls to the sound.  Phase cancellation is what makes outdoor concerts sound weird when the wind is blowing and you're about 100 yards away from the stage and the sound kinda shifts around and sounds, well, phasey..</div><div><br /></div><div>And then some nights, the PA and the amp and my bass are all playing nice with each other and you get that nice even low end.  A nice even low end means ceasing to consider the sound and actually listening to what my bandmates are playing.  That's a good night.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then some nights, the PA and the amp and my bass are all playing nice with each other, but we still can't get it sounding right.  That was last night.  It usually happens in a Big Room because the Big Room swallows sound waves and doesn't let them come back to you in time to be useful.  It sends them back to you much later so that it sounds like a delay on your entire band being blasted back at you.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then some nights the sound is so God awful that you just say fuck it, and those are usually really great nights.  Blacksburg was one of those.  It was in a tiny little basement of a club, my bass was acting up all night, but the crowd was blazing.  You can't possibly have a bad time in that situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now boarding.  Later...</div></p>

		<p>Alright! I finally have some time here. I apologize for the dearth of interesting verbiage from this blog over the last week or so. I&#8217;m still getting the hang of this whole thing, of course. <div><br /></div><div>One thing that I've realized on reflecting over the past week is that the whole method that I have of getting all fired to write and then putting out four things at a time is probably not the most effective means of running this blog.  I guess that's why none of the blogs that I've been reading do it that way.  So, I'm going to try and keep this to a more or less daily occurrence.  We'll all see how well that works out.</div><div><br /></div><div>So to catch up - </div><div><br /></div><div>I've picked up a second job here that has been working for me very well.  I more or less started last fall and it started as a one-off consulting gig that snowballed into more or less a full time thing.  The consulting gig was to help this marketing company/call center up in NJ get set up with a computer recording system.  They wanted to be able to do hold music or messaging for their clients for whom they provide an answering service.  It went well.  Spending other peoples money on recording gear and computers is the perfect job for me, but alas, they only needed one system to get the job done.  That led into another freelance gig rebuilding some old crappy computers that they had laying around into <a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=citrix&amp;l=1'>Citrix</a> clients, which led into some more involved networking and pretty much whatever they need, which is alot.  The head of IT at this place is a friend and fan of the band who keeps throwing me random jobs that I either already know how to do or can figure out with less babysitting than expected.  Their network guy is completely swamped at this place, so I've been learning a lot from him about Windows networking.  This is what has kept me away from the computer for 2 weeks now.  I've been pulling the 6am-3pm shift, and on my feet basically the whole time, so it hasn't left much time for writing, even if I did have something interesting to say.  I haven't though.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the few in between times that I have had time to screw around, I've been doing some tinkering around with RRE's web presence.  Check out our <a href='http://www.facebook.com/RailroadEarth#/RailroadEarth?v=box_3&amp;viewas=1134200354'>Facebook Page</a>, specifically the Boxes page, as that's the place where I've found the first foothold on the mountain that I've been sizing up for the last 9 months as far as this whole software/web development journey goes.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also got the codes to <a href='http://www.railroadearth.com/home_page/'>RRE's web page</a> and promptly learned why you don't do direct work on a live web page!  That was fun!  I got the site back up, fortunately, but there are a few broken links that I'll be fixing, on the local copy of the website, of course.  Stay tuned for those as well.  Now that I have the access, I intend to see what I can do with the RRE site as it is before I launch into my wet dream of a band website.</div><div><br /></div><div>Got a good Dummies book on a website framework called <a href='http://www.joomla.org/'>Joomla</a>, which seems very, very interesting.  It's what's known as a Content Management System, or CMS for short.  Joomla is an open source framework which is supposed to make it really easy to do exactly what I had the big idea about a few months ago.  It's a modular system for building, updating, and maintaining your web site with new content, new features, etc.  It's a cool idea, but also pretty mature and full featured.  This is good because it means that many of the bugs have been worked out for several years now.  This is bad because it means learning a LOT of stuff that I probably don't really need in the context of doing what I want to do.  I guess it's not so bad, since I like learning new stuff.</div><div><br /></div><div>Learned a little how <a href='http://www.livedownloads.com/live-music/3,66/Railroad-Earth-mp3-flac-downloads.html'>LiveDownloads</a> runs their operation from a content management standpoint.  I'm not gonna say, though, that'd probably be rude.</div><div><br /></div><div>Found another framework called <a href='http://drupal.org/'>Drupal</a>, which is actually what led me to Joomla.  It's another CMS, with a different paradigm.  We'll see which one I figure out first.</div><div><br /></div><div>Started grasping the concept of web servers and managed to get Apache up and running on my system.  I'd suggest if you're a brand newby to web design and aren't working in a Windows VB environment, you might want to check out <a href='http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html'>Xxamp</a>, as it bundles together basically every single open source gadget you're going to need to build and maintain a web site.</div><div><br /></div><div>Bought a domain, which will be the place I launch the early versions of all of this stuff to submit for your tinkering and inspection.  I'll let you know where it is when there's something there to look at.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sooooo, it's been a busy week.  Fortunately I'm back on the road now, in the sense that now I can catch up a bit on everything I have to do.  I only wish that I'd had this idea a few years ago.  I feel like I have an absurd amount of catching up to do.  Last night's show kicked ass, by the way...</div></p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/03/just-another-reason" title="Permalink">justAnotherReason</a></h2>
		<p>So Eminem&#8217;s old producers sued Universal over royalties. For those of you who have never been signed to a record contract, they are shadier (pardon the pun) than you probably imagine. The whole point of getting a record deal is to try and make some money off of selling your recording, right? Well, over the last decades, the industry (and by industry, I mean the lawyers and label heads in charge of finding ever more inventive ways of scamming inattentive rock stars (which is generally easier than shooting fish in a barrel)) has come up with some novel ideas about how your royalty rate should be calculated. They subtract the cost of all manner of promotional charges for the posters you see in the window of the record store, and then things like &#8220;breakage&#8221; (which hasn&#8217;t been a real issue since records were made of shellac), and then just arbitrarily lop off another 10% for this, and 10% for that, until by the end you&#8217;re not getting paid for the 1 million records you sold, you&#8217;re getting paid for maybe 500k of them, if you&#8217;re very lucky. Then they charge you back for some more (usually bogus) stuff. The whole game is to keep you, the artist, in the hole. It&#8217;s easy. Oh, the label is sending a limo to pick you up at the airport and take you to the Grammy&#8217;s! Great! Do I need to tip the driver?<div><br /></div><div>Add into this that their lawyers have seen fit to jump on digital distribution by making your royalty rate 75% (again, if you're lucky) of what it would be if there were a physical medium being sold through a store (and this is in addition to subtracting for "Breakage", etc.), and the margins for the artist get even lower.  It's pathetic, honestly.  Even more pathetic is that artists are usually in a big hurry to sign these pieces of shit.  </div><div><br /></div><div>So, when I read things like <a href='http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20090309/that-tiny-sum-its-your-digital-download-royalties-after-packaging-costs-and-breakage/'>this</a>, it really makes me wonder.  To sum up, Em's old producers sued over the fact that there were so many absurdly non-justifiable, pre-royalty charges added up before they got their cut.  They argue, and rightly so in my mind, that since you can't "break" a digital download, and the distribution costs are virtually nil, and that the labels aren't paying for in-store promotional material to market the download, that those charges shouldn't apply to their royalties.  They argued that the deals should work more like commercial and movie licensing agreements work.  That'd bring their cut up, as producers.  It'd also bring down the labels' cut, obviously.  The jury found for Universal, unfortunately...</div><div><br /></div><div>So when I read articles like the <a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/EELkxo88_yI/'>one that I posted earlier today</a>, I wonder why music label execs think we're all so stupid.  By "we", I don't just mean artists because there's plenty of empirical evidence that we are in fact, but the entire music listening populace.  Why do we want to consume the crap that they sell, ripping off artists in the process, ignoring or suppressing good music along the way?</div><div><br /></div><div>Time to get back on my musicTech thread...</div></p>

		<p>So RRE finally signed up on Twitter, right about the same time I succumbed to my curiosity on the same subject. In case you could tell by this blog, I&#8217;m completely fascinated by Web stuff like this. I mean, what a stupid concept, right? A micro-blog so that people can talk about what they&#8217;re doing at that moment. As if I need to know what Scotty Baron had for lunch today! But wait&#8230;<br /><br />The tech media is positively foaming at the mouth over this thing. Every marketing site I go to is praising it, every music business blog is blathering about how to use it, in 10 parts no less. So what is going on over here? I see this journalist over here mentioned that when the plane went down in the Hudson the first place he heard about it was on Twitter. He cruises around to some of the blogs he follows and none of them mentioned it until much later (in journalism time). Okay, so this could be a journalism tool. Outblog the bloggers. But wait&#8230;<br /><br />Part of what I personally find so thrilling about technology like this is the potential that it has to become, at it&#8217;s furthest extension, a tool for shining a light on the kind of evil that can only take place in the shadows. North Korean gulags, Egyptian or Saudi repression, Israeli actions against the Palistinians, Darfur, Kenya, Afghanistan, China, not to mention whatever the American gov&#8217;t has been up to over the past hundred years in terms of shady foreign policy wherever.<br /><br />I firmly believe that world harmony is at hand, and that once everyone has a cell phone and access to Twitter (or something like it), evil will have nowhere left to hide.</p>

		<p>Now, this part won&#8217;t be any news to anyone, but will mainly serve to help organize the thoughts in my brain. First, the old way:<div><br /></div></p>
<div>The old way involved the "record industry".  The record industry used to exist because recording was very expensive.  It was expensive to record a song, it was expensive to reproduce the recording of the song, and it was really expensive to warehouse, distribute, and sell the recording of that song.  Thus a whole industry cropped up to take advantage of the fact that the barrier to entry for your average recording artist, say Ma Carter out of the hills around Bristol VA, was so astronomically high that nobody really thought about releasing their own music.  Show up, play my tunes, get paid for them?  Okay!  This worked great for long enough for the basic oligarchic framework of the major label system to rise to power.</div><div>A moment now to reflect.  It's extremely popular to bash record labels, and with good reason.  Let us now take a moment, however, to reflect on the cultural purpose that they've served...</div><div>I take it for granted that America is, on balance, the coolest nation on the face of the earth, in the history of humanity.  Citizens from other countries would doubtless dispute this claim, but I would submit to you that even those societies that profess to hate everything America stands for only  hate so strongly because they don't enjoy the liberties and luxuries that Americans have long grown accustomed to.  Now, imagine if the record business never existed, that there was no such thing as an LP or a CD, and the only way to enjoy music was to go listen to it live.  There were no Beatles, except for those of you lucky enough to be in the Cavern Club, no Elvis, unless you went down to the BBQ shack to see him in Memphis, no Chuck Berry, no Led Zeppelin, no Pink Floyd, no Eagles, no Neil Young, no Bob Dylan, no Coldplay, no U2.  I know, a lot of these bands are from the UK, but I consider the give and take of the UK and the USA to be part of the competitive exchange that has pushed the limits of musical creativity for the better.  And we can safely lump all these bands into the category of Western Music.  Now, imagine if Western Music never existed.  How would we export our culture abroad?  At gunpoint, probably.  How would generations of kids be incited to stand up and make change happen?  At gunpoint, probably.  My point is that exactly at the moment in human events that the USA and the UK became 2 of the dominant political powers in the world (1946 or so), rock and roll made an appearance.  It moved legions of Japanese kids just like it did American kids.  The cultural service that the major label system provided these kids and us to come later is therefore immeasurable.  And the world danced together...</div><div><br /></div>

		<h2><a href="/2009/02/saas" title="Permalink">SaaS.</a></h2>
		<p>Ever heard of it? It stands for Software as a Service, and it&#8217;s a little sector of the software/tech business that everyone is keeping an eye on right now. One of the leading vendors of this service right now is a company called <a href='http://salesforce.com'>SalesForce.com</a>. My brother in law is actually their director of recruiting for the midwest region. What SaaS does is remove the need to buy software for your business. It moves the important stuff to the &#8220;cloud&#8221;, which is another name for the internet, and charges a monthly fee for the service. It&#8217;s the same concept as Gmail, except that enterprise software is big, big business. Software companies don&#8217;t just make a bundle when they sell it, they make a bigger bundle from selling the support contracts that every business inevitably needs to keep their company moving along.<div><br /></div><div>   So, SaaS removes the expense of buying, and instead rents you the software, along with the support, for however long you want it.  I'm not in the market right now, so I don't know how long the contracts last, but the point is that companies probably won't continue to buy enterprise software if this model works out like SalesForce.com hopes it will.  So far it's working like gangbusters.  They're projecting about $1.3B in revenue for 2010.</div><div><br /></div><div>   The correlating service in the music business would be something like Napster, I guess.  You pay a monthly fee and you get access to their whole database of music.  Services like these haven't taken off for crap, mostly because iTunes already owns the market and it's still just too easy to rip music off for free.  iTunes has proven such a success because they really do make it super easy to get what you want, the prices are reasonable, and they don't even insist on that DRM crap anymore (which was only there in the first place because the majors insisted on it).  </div><div><br /></div><div>    What if a band with a pre-established fanbase wanted to try this out on their own?  What if there were very regularly updated music, video, whatever on a site dedicated to the band, and the only place you could get that stuff was from that website?  What if it were super simple for anyone to use, and super affordable for anyone to join?  In other words, what if it were worth it?  </div><div><br /></div><div>   Would people try it?  </div><div><br /></div><div>   Would bands try it?</div><div><br /></div><div>   If the other option is to put out another CD that you can only buy at the merch table, or maybe online somewhere and even then only if you're already looking for it, I think this could be a way forward for a really motivated band.</div></p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/02/health" title="Permalink">Health.</a></h2>
		<p>I started running about this time last year. I hadn&#8217;t exercised regularly since college, where they gave you gym access along with your tuition. I spent the rest of my 20s gaining about 2 or 3 pounds a year, and not really doing much in the way of taking care of myself. It had occurred to me that the only exercise I was really ever going to be able to afford was running, but I <i>hate</i> running. I kept up this hope that some day I was going to be able to at least join a YMCA with a pool or something, as that was much more my speed.<div>    I had a big winter last year, with the birth of my baby boy right in the middle of it.  I had the same realization that I had had in college 11 years earlier - that one simple little thing that I could that would make me feel better was to start getting some regular exercise again.  So I dug my running shoes out of the closet, as I had tried this before, and got started.  The first mile isn't as hard as the second mile.  And it must've taken me six months of plugging away at just running those two miles without stopping, but once I got over the hump, I really got over the hump.</div><div>    My short run around where I live is right at 4 miles long, and I try to do that every other day when the weather allows.  I start getting really antsy if I go more than a week.  Without a shadow of a doubt, I'm in the best shape I've ever been in.  I lost the pounds and then some, and haven't really relapsed at all as far as bad eating habits.  My wife Michelle is a veg, so it's easy when I'm home, but I've managed to keep at it on the road with greater and greater success.  I got up yesterday at 7:30 and went for about 3.5 with my buddy Matt, and then did another 3 or so here in Charleston.  As you can tell, this is about nothing in particular, but if you hate running as bad as I did, there's a very good chance that you could love it as much as I do now...</div></p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/02/computers" title="Permalink">Computers.</a></h2>
		<p>Let me just say this, and I was a big PC defender/Mac smack-talker for many years. The adjustment period, when I bought my Mac last summer, was about an hour long. I just had to get used to closing windows in the left side of the screen instead of the right. Since the adjustment period has ended, and working on this thing has become sort of an extension of my arms, I gotta tell you - Macs just stay out of your way. It&#8217;s that simple. I don&#8217;t fight with it. i don&#8217;t have to reboot or reinstall. I don&#8217;t even have to think about it. When I got my iPhone a year and a half ago, I knew that this was a tool that would allow the most unorganized person to have a ball getting their shit together. That person is me. I&#8217;m pretty sure if i take the time to plot out some sort of productivity index for my life, it&#8217;s going to start showing some serious upward movement around July of 08.</p>

		<h2><a href="/2009/02/toward-point" title="Permalink">Toward the point...</a></h2>
		<p>Okay, so this blog is gonna be really boring if I do it in chronological order. I want to make sure that my two readers so far have something to look forward to besides cleaning out my mental closet.<br /><br /> I had an idea for a business that would be really cool if someone started.<br /><br /> I&#8217;m in a band that gets virtually no love from the mainstream media, the major record labels, the world at large&#8230;Yet, we&#8217;ve been together for 8 years now. I&#8217;ve been in the band for 6. When I first joined the band we were buying a van from a liquor store parking lot so that we could get around the country more comfortably and reliably. That van turned 300,ooo miles last weekend. We played Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire. In February. &#8220;This is ridiculous&#8221; we thought to ourselves. Yet, we sold out the little place we played in ME, and the huge place we played in VT. Turns out cabin fever is a good thing for your band. But we do this all the time.<br /><br /> You take your average artist that&#8217;s on a major label, that&#8217;s on the radio or MTV, and we draw more people to any given show in any given town than probably 90% of them. That there&#8217;s something going on here is plain for anyone to see. That we&#8217;re impossible to &#8220;market&#8221; in the traditional sense, in the traditional way is equally plain, to me at least. I don&#8217;t even know how to answer the question &#8220;What kind of music do you guys play?&#8221; and I&#8217;ve been looking for a straight reply for 6 years. So I don&#8217;t get frustrated when we put out a new record and it doesn&#8217;t sell, or get the media response that I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll get, or when the good radio play we&#8217;re actually getting for the first time doesn&#8217;t actualy translate into any hard numbers. Okay, so I do, but does it really matter? If you&#8217;re a fan of RRE, how did you find RRE? Was it seeing an article in the paper, or a magazine? Was it by hearing us on XM/Sirius?<br /><br /> It may have been, but I&#8217;d say chances are pretty strong that either one of your friends turned you on to us, or that you stumbled across us on the internet. That tells me something.</p>

		<p>To speak into the void.<br /><br /> So I&#8217;ve had this idea simmering on the front burner of my brain for several months now. But first, I should probably introduce myself, or do a bio, or something. Maybe this will take several parts, because I&#8217;ve never tried to write a bio, and I feel like I&#8217;ve done a good job living unconventionally with my first 30 years here&#8230;<br /><br /> I was born in ATL, Georgia, that is. No brothers or sisters. Great parents. Always totally behind me for some reason. I got pretty mediocre grades at the private school they sent me to, and spent most of my time getting in trouble. Nothing big ever, no real cause for concern, I just didn&#8217;t really feel like fitting into their mold over there. I realize now in hindsight that I left high school with pretty low self esteem after being told for half of my life what an underachiever I was, how much potential I had that if I just &#8220;applied myself&#8221;. I had some really good friends, though, and at some point found music. <br /><br /> I&#8217;d been in the school band since 6th grade, trombone. I realize now that I never knew how to read music. I think I learned the parts by listening to whomever I was sitting next to. That amazes me in hindsight, but nobody picked up on it, least of all me. I was that into the trombone anyway, I was much more into the drums. I used to get on my band directors nerve because as soon as we got into the room I&#8217;d be back in the percussion section, not learning the trombone parts. <br /><br /> &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you just switch to percussion?&#8221; you might ask..<br /><br /> &#8220;Because we need trombones&#8221; was the answer I got for years and years whenever I asked to switch to percussion.<br /><br /> There was one time that I was really into building model planes. I didn&#8217;t use plastic cement, for some reason I used a hot glue gun. It was messy and my models turned out looking like crap, but that&#8217;s not the point. One time I&#8217;d set my glue gun down, with it pointing into my glass of water. It had dripped some hot glue into the glass, apparently, right before I took a sip. I burned the crap out of my top lip and had a huge ugly scab for weeks. The band concert was coming up that week. I couldn&#8217;t play the trombone. I got to be a percussionist for a week. It was like heaven. I couldn&#8217;t read music for the bass drum either, but I damn sure could make the part up. Nobody ever knew, and I never told them. I totally forgot about that until now.<br /><br /> Anyway, I forget why, but at some point I got more or less kicked out of the band. I think I skipped a mandatory concert to go on a youth group trip with my church. I asked them if I could skip the concert to go on a youth group trip and they said &#8220;no&#8221;. This would&#8217;ve been a reasonable answer, except that five minutes before my best friends James had asked them if he could go on the exact same trip that I was asking to go on, and they told him &#8220;sure&#8221;. So I went anyway. Now I remember why. Amazing this blogging&#8230;<br /><br /> Anyway, now I&#8217;m in a band, and right now I&#8217;m on a tour bus heading to the GA theater in Athens. I&#8217;ve got some time to kill, so I&#8217;ll keep catching you up, whoever you are. At this rate, I&#8217;ll get to my big idea in another 20 posts or so.</p>
