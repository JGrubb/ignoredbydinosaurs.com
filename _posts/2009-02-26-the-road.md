It wears you _out_.  All the stories about how road eventually grinds good musicians into dust may be partially true.  I'd suspect that it has more to do with drugs and alcohol on the road grinding musicians into dust.  I don't have that problem, so mainly it just wears me out.

Exhaustion is a state that usually lends itself to some good playing, at least for me.  Last night I was so tired I think my brain went into some kind of alpha dream state during the second set.  That's when I do my best thinking when I have the energy, but not last night.  Just laying down with the roots...
