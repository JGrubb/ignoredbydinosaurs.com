I'm relocating some stuff this week.  I've just bought a year of hosting with Media Temple, which seems to be where all the cool kids are parking their websites, and trying concurrently to transfer all manner of domains and live websites to said host.  This should be a lot of fun.  I'll probably hose a lot of stuff this week, this website, the new forum, who knows what else.  By the way, if you're thinking about registering a domain name, don't go Google Apps to do it.  They are a partner with GoDaddy, so just skip the middleman and go straight to GoDaddy.  I've had many issues with having the domain and the hosting plan under two different accounts at GoDaddy/Google.  Live and learn...

At the end of this tunnel, however, I'll have several new notches in my belt and will be ready to confidently take on your website.

You have a website, right?
