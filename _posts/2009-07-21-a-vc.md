I really like Fred Wilson's blog.  He's a tech VC (venture capitalist) based in New York.  He's steady, and often I fall behind since he puts out some good stuff on a daily basis.  Following the tack of this post, Facebook just added an SMS friend feature to their business pages.  All you do if you're not already a fan is text "fan RailroadEarth" to whatever the number is.  The question I could use your assistance with is how best to get the word out about this.  Seems to me like getting folks at the show would be the best way to capitalize on this, but obviously we're not going to announce it from the stage.  Any ideas?

Edit: We have a winner, folks!  Allan Ronquillo has sent a complete battle plan - a work that deserves intensive study.  If he doesn't mind I'll put it up here...
