It's been an inordinately long break, friends, and for that I apologize.  I've been engaged on a weeks-long bender of brain expanding self-education on many fronts, plotting medium and long term career paths, taking stock of the current situation and options.  For fans of the band I'm in, have no fear, I have no options at this point.  The dearth of verbiage here goes hand in hand with the intense push to expand the possibilities there.
