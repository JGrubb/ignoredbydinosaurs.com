And by "Great", I don't mean awesome.  

For those of you who don't know what I mean when I say Lorem Ipsum, it's standard gibberish copy put in place of the real copy that's going into your design.  It's been used for decades if not centuries to allow creative teams to test out different visual designs and know what it'll look like when some words get put in there.

So what's wrong with this?
----------------------

I just built a website for a friend over the last half of last week.  The designer and I worked together marvelously, which is great because it was our first gig.  She was totally into trying out the [cool, new tool](https://trello.com/) that launched last week to see if it would help keep us organized while in a hurry (our launch date is today - Monday).  The project manager was the one in charge of dealing with the ADD client, so it was really a perfect scenario.  We went with Wordpress since everyone was familiar with it.

Friday evening I got a Word doc of the site's copy.   I don't like placing copy in websites, but whatever.  At least it wasn't in all caps.

This morning I open it up and at least half of the pages are  "coming soon".  Approximately half of the remaining pages are four sentences or less.  I'm all about white space, but this is a _bit too much_.  

That's when the title of this post popped into my head.

Simple Rule for Marketing Websites
------------------------------

If you do the design first and the copy last, you lose.  If you do the copy first and the design second, you stand a much better chance at succeeding with both.
