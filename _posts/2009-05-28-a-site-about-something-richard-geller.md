Okay, I'm not a fan of Flash.  I'm not sure why except that I think it's kinda like the B3 organ for me.  It's great when someone uses it tastefully, but I've heard so many bands/albums misusing the B3 that it's kinda ruined for me.

This guy's got the right idea, however.  If my whole aesthetic weren't about clean and direct these days, I'd want to do something like this.
