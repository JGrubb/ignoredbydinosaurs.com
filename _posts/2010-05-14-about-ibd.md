ignoredByDinosaurs is an idea at this point. It was born out of a long held notion that someone somewhere must have an idea about where the music industry is headed. I've held this belief for so long while living my life as a musician and artist and student of culture and society that I've kissed it goodbye. I realized about a year ago that nobody anywhere even had a clue, never mind a plan that saved what was worth saving about the music industry - the music part.

Not long after that I was riding in a van on the way to a gig in Maine when the phrase "ignored by dinosaurs" popped into my head. That's what we are, after all. I thought it was a stupid name then, but it stuck, and I never came up with one that better encapsulated the feeling I had that the point and the solution were being hugely missed. I'd already begun my self-education in software development, so later that week I bought the domain. Here we are

In the months since then, the concept has morphed and grown, but the idea has stayed the same. _If the music business is ever going to be saved, if musicians are ever going to be allowed a chance to achieve a minimum standard of living, if we are going to rescue music itself from it's place as today's disposable trinket and restore it's place as the universal human language, then the paradigm has got to be completely and utterly reinvented._ That's what I'm here to do. Thanks for joining me.
