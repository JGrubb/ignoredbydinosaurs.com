So, if you're in a band and you don't have a website, you're not really a band, right?  If you own a business and you don't have a website, your business doesn't really exist, right?  If you ran a festival, could you see how you could get by without having a website?

The iPhone, and the mobile platform in general, is going to be the means by which info is spread, by which content is delivered, by which people are entertained and kept in the loop.  The portable website, but better.  Can we all agree on that much?
