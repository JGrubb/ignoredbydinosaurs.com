[This](http://radar.oreilly.com/assets_c/2009/02/TM_qtr_py_Prog_Lang.html) is a table I found that shows relative current interest in different computer programming languages.  This was put together by measuring the book sales of books covering a specific language as compared to their sales from the year before.  The size of the box tells their relative market share, and the color their relative market traction.  You'll notice the really bright green one at the top, up 965%, is for Objective-C.  Mac OS X applications, and iPhone applications are written in this language.  I have personally contributed at least 2 purchases to that square over the last year...
