So, I cruised by the Duster's site yesterday and noticed waaay down on their blog page that they had posted a link to the ENB site when I was coming on board.

I just wanted to take a moment to reflect on how classy that is, and why those dudes are going to make it.

You think my old band would ever, ever have done that in a million years?  NO.  Why?  Because there's a really fucked up culture on the inside of that band.  It's the same shit that corporate ladder climbing jerks purvey where if someone else is doing well, that's a bad thing for you.  It's basically born of ego and insecurity and I'm really glad to not be part of it anymore, because it's completely defeatist in the end.

Long live the Dusters and the bluegrass scene.
