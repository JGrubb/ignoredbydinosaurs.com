My vet just recently joined the 21st century and moved all of their records from big, brown paper files to a computer system.  Her husband is an IT guy so he did the research and picked out all the computers, networked them together and set up this software system for the office.  It looked like a pretty big job to migrate all of their client records to a computer system, but hey, the avoided it long enough, right?

I don't know why I just thought of this, but about a web app that manages all of that stuff?  Clients, their pets, their pets' histories, etc.  Then I thought, well, that's kinda ballsy for a vet's office to let a web service store data like that, and what if you want to move, etc.  Well, okay, how about some kind of export API etc.  Then I thought, well what about hosting the database at the client end...

Would this be a case for something like CouchDB or MongoDB?  A local datastore, and I would provide the processing and the upkeep?  I dunno.  I'm gonna sleep on it.  Sounds like a fun little project in any case...
