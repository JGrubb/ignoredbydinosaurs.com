Well, this blog has hit version 3.0, with today's torturous migration from WordPress to Drupal.  Why put myself through such an ordeal?  Because if I'm going to paint my masterpiece, I'm going to have to start butchering some canvasses, and Drupal seems to beg for me to hack away at it.  That and there is a world of flexibility in this platform that doesn't really exist in WP.  

It'll be a process of getting up to speed and making this look and feel and act as nicely as the old iBD, but once I get going, expect some actual development here.

Thanks, friends.  Oh, and in case you were wondering what happening to all of RRE's web properties today, I don't know anything about it...
