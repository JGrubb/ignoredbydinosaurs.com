<p>When in the course of your bands business, it becomes necessary to cast off your old, crappy website and the confusing, unnavigable interface which you present to the world as your first impression, and to assume the powers of PHP, CSS, XML, RoR, and other technologies not yet invented in the pursuit of a highly compelling online experience, a more meaningful dialogue with your fanbase, and the glorious rewards of possibly higher merch sales, a decent respect to the opinions of webmasters everywhere requires that I should declare the causes which impel me to dream of a better way....</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all websites are <em>not</em> created equal, yet they are endowed by their creators with the potential to be entertaining, informative, and even useful in a utilitarian sense.  That to secure these ideals, most bands stumble blindly about with no technical idea of what's involved in actually building a modern website, that the layout and information contained in your average band website has been virtually untouched for several years in a field where technology is changing every day.  That the potential for truly democratizing the music industry has never been more at hand than it is today.  That nobody in the business of selling records is interested in seeing a better system devised.  That the only way forward for the record industry is via the ubiquitous distribution system present in every one of your homes.  That the only way to achieve such independence is to fight for change, to take up development tools, and to learn what bands and the music business are doing wrong, and to right these wrongs.</p>

<p>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that those of us yearning for change learn as much as we can about the technologies available, so that we may make best use of them and not stumble where so many of our brethren have before.  This blog shall henceforth detail my quest to overhaul the sorry state of affairs that is the music recording industry, so that it may brighten all of our lives forevermore...</p>
