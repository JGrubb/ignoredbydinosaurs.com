\- the Daring Fireball in a piece called <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/microsofts_long_slow_decline">Microsoft's long, slow decline</a>.  He sums up my feelings almost perfectly.  I apologize ahead of time for being a snobby Mac asshole, but feel my decades of loyalty to MS-DOS and Windows justify and inform my opinions sufficiently.
