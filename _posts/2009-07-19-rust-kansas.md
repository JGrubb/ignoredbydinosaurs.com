It feels like ages since my last post, even though I've tried to keep it up with some links to some good dorkery.  Today is spent in the bus, driving the 735 miles from Denver to Columbia, MO.  We left at 9 this morning and have made a small dent in Kansas, but we'll most likely be rolling in around midnight or so tonight.  So here goes...

I'm very excited about it.  I'd tell you where it's stashed, but not only do I want it to be a surprise to as many people as possible, the metrics tell me that perhaps a few of you have already found it.  

Pardon my lack of anything interesting to say, but my creative fire seems to go in cycles.  I've had to venture into the woods for more firewood lately, and will hopefully have more to say one of these days.
