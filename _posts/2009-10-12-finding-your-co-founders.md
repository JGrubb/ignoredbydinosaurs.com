<a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/WOsw5tuHYkw/">Finding Your Co-Founders</a>: "The hardest part of starting from scratch is finding the right co-founders. Ideas, comparatively, are easy. You may spend three years finding your co-founders while you’ll come up with a solid idea every 3 months or so. Luckily, once you settle into a great founding team you’ll be able to execute much faster on that killer idea you all come up with – beating those ten other folks who came up with the same idea at the same time."

Yes.
