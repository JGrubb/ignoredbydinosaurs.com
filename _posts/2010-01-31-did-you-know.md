<p>...that the DOJ approved the merger of everyone's two favorite companies in the touring business - TicketMaster and LiveNation?  They found no reason to have anti-trust concerns with a merger between a monopolistic ticket service and a monopolistic concert promoter/venue owner.  But wait!  There's more!</p>

<p>One person who may have had some input into this decision was FCC chairman Julius Genachowski.  Fun fact about Mr. Genachowski - one of his previous gigs before he came to Washington was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Genachowski">on the board of directors at - wait for it - TicketMaster</a>!  I'm sure there was no conflict of interest if he did in fact have a say in this decision.</p>

<p>I'm sure we've all heard of Obama's hard-ass chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel.  Fun fact about Mr. Emanuel - his brother, Ari, is a hard-ass Hollywood talent agent.  He was supposedly the inspiration behind the character Ari on the HBO show Entourage.  I'm sure that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Emanuel">his being on the board of directors at LiveNation</a> played no part in swaying the DOJ's decision to let this absurdly anti-competitive, big-business friendly decision to go through.</p>

<p>I might as well have voted for Palin...</p>
