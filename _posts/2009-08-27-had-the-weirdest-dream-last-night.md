Travelling, of course.  By myself, of course.  In Georgia.  Train terminal in middle GA, taking a train to Europe.  Forgot my wallet - had to go back and get it.  got lost.  Couldn't find my way, repeatedly.  Ended up in McDonough, but it was huge and congested.  Met some hippy kids.  Ended up at a music store.  Ended up in the rain.  Ended up outside McDonough and it was a giant city on a hill.  Beautiful.  

Was telling Michelle about it and she said it sounded like my life.
