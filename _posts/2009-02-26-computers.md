Let me just say this, and I was a big PC defender/Mac smack-talker for many years.  The adjustment period, when I bought my Mac last summer, was about an hour long.  I just had to get used to closing windows in the left side of the screen instead of the right.  Since the adjustment period has ended, and working on this thing has become sort of an extension of my arms, I gotta tell you - Macs just stay out of your way.  It's that simple.  I don't fight with it.  i don't have to reboot or reinstall.  I don't even have to think about it.  When I got my iPhone a year and a half ago, I knew that this was a tool that would allow the most unorganized person to have a ball getting their shit together.  That person is me.  I'm pretty sure if i take the time to plot out some sort of productivity index for my life, it's going to start showing some serious upward movement around July of 08.
