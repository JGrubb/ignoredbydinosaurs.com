    <p>I use Git. I&#8217;m relatively new to the party and it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve ever used. I tried to get SVN working for me back when I was first gettings started and it felt like hand-wiring a tube amplifier - slow, tedious, and you don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to work until you&#8217;re totally done. I&#8217;ve more recently taken on a client who uses a nifty issue tracker called Jira, but they have their source checked in to SVN. I thought I was going to to have to get familiar with it until I rediscovered a tool that comes with Git called git-svn. It works pretty transparently after learning a couple of new commands.</p>

<p>This morning however, I tried something new and was greeted with this (after 5 hours of work).</p>

<p>This is a Drupal site that I&#8217;m working on. To make a long story short, I decided to pull a new module over via Git from drupal.org instead of using Drush like I always do. I figured I might want to chip in on some of the development of this module while I&#8217;m already here. Everything went fine, I added the .git folder within the module to .gitignore and went on my way. After finishing up enough of the work to send it over to staging and attempting a <code>git svn dcommit</code> I get the horrifying error above.</p>

<p>I found <a href='http://de-co-de.blogspot.com/2009/02/git-svn-and-submodules.html'>this post</a> that got me started down the right track. I used a different approach, though. I used the technique of rewriting the history with the info <a href='http://help.github.com/remove-sensitive-data/'>found here</a>. I&#8217;m pretty familiar with removing accidentally committed DB passwords, and wasn&#8217;t familiar with the technique that he had commented out in that post. Worked like a charm, and am now back on track.</p>

<p>To sum up, you delete the offending directory and then run something to the effect of</p>
<code>
git filter-branch --index-filter \
 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/the/formerly/misbehaving/module'
</code>
<p>from the base path of the git repo. By the way, that backslash doesn&#8217;t do anything but allow you to wrap a command to two lines. You can leave it out if you want and just type all that as one long line.</p>

<p>The culprit of all this is that git-svn specifically chokes on git repos below the main one, as is the case if you <code>git clone</code> a module straight off of d.o. So, sorry kids, you&#8217;ll have to contribute that code in some other way.</p>
