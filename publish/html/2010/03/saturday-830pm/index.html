    <p>Well, it has been quite some time, hasn&#8217;t it? So much has changed! So much is still the same! Where to begin? I&#8217;ve once again written this post in my head so many times that I don&#8217;t know where to start. How about the first thing that jumps to mind?</p>

<p>Okay, the first thing that jumps to mind is that I just found a card in my backpack yesterday. It was given to me on new years in Portland, the night of my last show with RRE. I don&#8217;t remember who gave it to me, which was probably their plan (or maybe I was just so out of it that I really don&#8217;t remember).</p>

<p>Anyway, later that night I was sitting in Mark-a-rita&#8217;s hotel room and realized that I&#8217;d been carrying this card around in my pocket all night and maybe I should open it and see what it was. It was from everyone in the room, which was basically a great number of my really close friends from the RRE experience. As soon as I a saw all the signatures on it and a couple of the things that people had written I shoved it back in the envelope. I heard somebody behind me say &#8220;Oh, did he just open it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t read it then because I was totally overwhelmed. From the time that I announced that I was leaving the band to that night at the Aladdin I was completely flooded with so much emotion from so many people with whom I&#8217;d shared most of my adult life that I myself was emotionally paralyzed. It was amazing, and amazingly difficult. Most Sundays after gig weekends during that period I would spend at least a little while crying and not knowing why. I was leaving of my own free will and for reasons that were plenty good enough for me. What was this all about?</p>

<p>By the time I got to Portland I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore. I&#8217;d had enough of people being so nice to me. I didn&#8217;t deserve it. People gave me cards with hundreds of signatures on them telling me that I&#8217;d be missed. Someone organized a can drive in my name at our Thanksgiving show, for Pete&#8217;s sake. What did I do? I just played the bass! I&#8217;d have been doing it anyway, hopefully, and instead I got to make friends and play shows and get good at the bass and be a rockstar for years. I didn&#8217;t deserve this outpouring.</p>

<p>So, to anyone reading this who was around in that period, this one&#8217;s for you.</p>

<p>I know I&#8217;ll see some of you again, but I&#8217;ll never see all of you again. My life has been a blessing, a dream. When I can transcend my neurosis and the chaos of my life currently for a few brief moments and really just take a breath, I feel so profoundly grateful for being a part of it. You and I made it together, and it was so. much. FUN! I kind of get it now, some of what there was to be sad about. Change is usually a wonderful thing, a necessary thing, but in a sense I feel like I&#8217;ve quit my family. Like I&#8217;ve spit in the face of the thing that we built. For that I&#8217;m both sorry and thankful for having had the experience in the first place.</p>

<p>I guess that&#8217;ll do for now. Hopefully this gets the writer&#8217;s clog out. I love you guys.</p>
