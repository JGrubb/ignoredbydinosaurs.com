Oh, yeah... The Holy frickin Grail.  The MVC framework that's sweeping the land fell under my text editor yesterday.

I hacked my way into Ruby on Rails.

I built a website yesterday in two hours that does more than anything I've done in the last nine months.  Granted, it doesn't look that great, but it's functional.  Also granted, it took me nine months to put the conceptual pieces together, and to find the technical resources to do something with the RoR framework that I downloaded 6 weeks ago, and to figure out how to install all manner of seriously deep Unix command line shit, but so help me, it's an exhilarating feeling.

Okay, so RoR isn't the Holy Grail, iPhone apps are, for me.  iPhone apps are written in a language that's not Ruby, but the MVC architecture is the same.  What I'm <i>hoping</i> that this means is that all this cool stuff that I'm learning about building Ruby stuff will translate nicely to building Obj-C stuff.  The work that I've done over the past 2 weeks with PHP was heavily informed by the one class I took on straight C, so I'm optimistic.  

I'm in Davenport IA right now.  It's cold, but the sun is shining.  Sorry I've been out of touch, but touring really does kinda wear you out.  I'm not saying it's hard, but it does wear you out.

Peace...
