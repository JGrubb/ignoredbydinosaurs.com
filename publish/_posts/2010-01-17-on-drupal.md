So far it's been a little boring.  I've added a few modules, mostly to achieve some comment functionality that Wordpress comes with almost out of the box, and somehow I find my database up to 90+ tables.  And the comments don't even really work that well.

So, in researching how to move from Drupal to Wordpress (since I've of course been doing mountains of Wordpress hacking for the last weeks since moving to Drupal), I've discovered that it's basically not easily doable, due to the above mentioned database bloat and variety of setups.  Thus...

Version 4.0 shall be a Rails app.  I've said this before, but I'm going to have to manually import all of my old posts and comments shit like that in via SQL most likely.  To the layman this means a lot of interesting and educational work.  I'll bet I can copy what I need for a functional blog in <10 tables.  Probably more like <6.

You'll know.  thanks for stopping by.  I'll have something more interesting to write about soon.
