My cherry is no more.  Yesterday I fired off <a href="http://railroadearth.com">my first real website</a>.  Nothing exploded except for the email for a little bit.  Turns out when you switch servers, the email and the website don't show up at the same time.  So most of today was spent learning about MX servers and stuff.  The documentation out there about what to expect from your website when you pull a host change is quite shitty, so I'll have to write a chapter in the <a href="http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/category/the-book/">Moron's Guide</a> about it.

Anyway, I'm totally fried, and taking a break from the Thesis Wordpress theme for a bit.  It's great, but I need to get sharp with some CSS skills now so that I can get on with the style now that I know somewhat how to walk.
