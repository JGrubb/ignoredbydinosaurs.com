I don't know why it took me so long to bop on over to the app store and search Wordpress, but of course there's an iPhone app! I'll use it now to distract myself while Sheaffer drives us to the airport. 

We're headed to the Mile High music festival in Denver tonight. We're playing tomorrow afternoon at the exact same time as Ani DiFranco, which is a real bummer because she was the best set of music I saw all weekend at Rothbury. I'd never seen her play before, and all I can say is Holy Crap. She played the Sherwood stage, which faces that forest you might have heard about. She played her song Napolean, which I'd never heard before. Sitting there on the side of the stage with her voice echoing off the forest was the best way to hear a tune like that for the first time. I'm kind of in love with her now. Anyway...
