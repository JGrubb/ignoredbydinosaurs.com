For my band, for my band...

Would any of you care to help out with putting together yet another online community?  The aim with this one is to try and organize Railroad Earth's online presence just a bit, mainly so that newcomers can have a better central clearinghouse for RRE info and community before swimming into deeper waters.  This probably isn't the most expeditious place to post this, but I'm trying to keep this kinda small while we're hammering out the design details.

That said, if you're an RRE fan, or a curious onlooker, please check it out here, and feel free to let me know of any annoying settings that you discover that I might be able to change.
