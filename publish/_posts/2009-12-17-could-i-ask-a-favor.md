I'm testing out this new comment notification system that will supposedly email me when people leave comments, with the aim of making this website (that's getting a tiny bit of action now) a little more conversationally interesting.  Would you mind leaving a comment down there?  And if there's already one there, would you engage that person in some banter?  Supposedly they'll get email, too, unless they untick the "notify me" box.

I appreciate it.  By the way, I don't think it's working and I've been debugging it all day.  But maybe it just needs a new post to work.  I dunno.  Drupal's tricky.

Edit: It's working now.  Thanks.
