But the individual bands who have a dedicated fanbase, they are the ones who could appreciate and go far with this type of service. I have worked with a company for years but it was awhile ago who only thrived on subscriberships. The content is key. If the content is worthy and not available anywhere else and is affordable (keep in mind we are in a downturn here in the economy), I do think that it could work. It would also differentiate the band from all the others out there. All I can say is Sopranos. The content makes a proposal such as yours above viable. It keeps the people coming back and making the subscribership worth it. I have Sirius, I have cable, etc. As a music fan of said band, if I felt it was worth something to me then a service like that would work. It connects the fans with the band.

This is a nice reveue stream, for sure, as you know there&#39;s a built-in fanbase for this. Even selling a couple thousand a month at $.99 has to have an upside.

I\'ll never forget when they delivered my first cell phone to me.  \r\n\r\nVerizon had the \"test drive\" a couple of years back so I went out and cheated on AT&amp;T.  I got myself and Sherry two phones and Verizon\'s service that I heard was so great and so wonderful.  I returned both phones within 24 hours.  The customer service is terrible (for all Verizon services) and there were a lot of hidden fees that were not disclosed, pertaining to VZ Navigator and Internet usage.  Maybe the fault of the salesman, maybe not.  When I did return these devices within 24 hours, they tried to charge me hundreds of dollars.  What is a \"test drive\" then?  After many calls to Verizon\'s customer service (\"Agent\"! \"Representative!\"), I was finally successful in getting all charges wiped.  Needless to say, I am back where I belong, in the arms of my trusty friend - AT&amp;T.  I am one of those who may not need an iPhone, but for $99, how could I not?  I bought two again, one for me and one for Sherry.  Unfortunately, Sherry could not use hers due to fingernails.  Maybe the salesman should have told me that this phone is not for the female gender who likes fingernails.  But he did not, and when I returned the phone the next day, they did not charge me at all.  My bill included an activation charge for the phone, but when I called, I was able to quickly get to a live agent who immediately removed the charge.  The iPhone may not be blazing fast and maybe it has slowed down to \"old\" users, but patience is a virtue, my friend.  And in the few extra seconds it takes for the app to load, I take a few extra seconds to look around and ponder the amazement of what I\'m actually holding in my hand.  A computer, smaller than an old Texas Instrument calculator I had to lug around high school.  To make it even better, I never used to have any service in my office, and since I got the iPhone and updated the OS, I have full service.  Coincidence?  I don\'t believe so.\r\n\r\nCall me a believer, and an AT&amp;T (Cingular) subscriber for life.','','1248409535','0','0','03/','Scotty','rails20@yahoo.com','');

Maybe a bit more then the ordinary person. But to me, music has always been a big factor in my life. When you are at work, it helps the day go by and sometimes even settles you down so you can focus. When taking long drives it gives you that extra encouragement to keep you going and reach your destination. When your happy it makes you smile even more. When you are dating and in love, there were songs that always expressed what you are feeling at the moment in time. When you are contemplative it makes you think that much more and even when you are sad or suffered a loss, music seems to put words and song out there that reflect the mood of your misfortune. See for many of us creative challenged folks, who are not singers, songwriters or musicians, there was always some type of music or song or lyric that helped us put things in perspective and literally showcased what we were feeling at any given time. The connection to the song becomes a connection to the artist and then we beome fans. Many of us say, \"that particular music spoke to me, they know how I am feeling right now. I can&#39;t express it but they know what I am going throught right now. I am going to listen to this artist more often.\" <br><br>See I didn&#39;t really get it when I was growing up. Hell, I put on a record, CD, tape of something I wanted to listen to and that was that. It was not till my teenage years where I saw how powerful music can be. My mind opened up and the music was now been truly heard. The notes, the lyrics, the emotion it connotates, it was all there if you just gave it a chance. Since I opened up my mind to that space, one could seriously shut their eyes and you were taking onto this musical journey through each song that one listened to. You felt enveloped in this song. You were wrapped up on a mission to see it through and listen to the last notes. My mindset for music changed dramatically. It grew into an understanding that there are similar folks out there that do get it, they can hear what I am hearing. They can see what I am seeing. And if you saw it live, it was that much sweeter, that much more powerful. <br><br>There is a thing that happens at a show between the audience and the band. A connectivity that can either be nurtured or loss throughout the evening of said show. When the connection is right and things are flowing back and forth, that is the special place that everyone in the room strives to be at. When the connection is not found, the live music seems to be flat with no where to go. I have sat, stood, witnessed, listened and have partaking in what I will call the spiritual realm between fan and band time and time again. When the musicians are on their game and they step up and really play, the fans take notice and feel that through the notes, the song, the way the musician interacts with the audience. They feel the music that moves their soul. This great playing on stage turns on that switch, the spiritual connection begins and the flow of energy is felt throughout that venue. With like minded music individuals in the same venue, the audience also now has that chance to join in on the fun. They feel it, the are moved by it. So they sing along, dance, hoot and holler and just create a whirlwind of energy feeding that spiritual realm. As long as the band keeps playing on that special plane, the vibe in that venue will always be there for them. I have witnessed it time and time again. I have participated in this exchange of positiveness to that spiritual connnection from audience to stage. <br><br>So coming back from these past two nights of Railroad being in upstate New York and Toronto, I just have to say that the spiritual realm was hit. I was in those audiences feeling the positive energy from the crowd. Because the music that was being played off of that stage was so good, the audience gave all their appreciation. They were truly taken on a train ride. All those folks that were there wanted to be there. They wanted to witness first hand what the buzz was about. They all walked away praying that Railroad would come back again real soon so they can hit that spiritual plane once more. It is like a drug in a way as you get addicted to that special feeling that Railroad Earth creates when a show is played well and the audience is on. The mixture creates this feeling of euphoria when RRE hits that spiritual plane and hangs there for a couple of hours. That was the buzz all over the place up there. When an audience explodes at the end of each set and before the encore like that, you as musicians have played well. You reached that point where they can see the music when they close their eyes. You took them on a musical journey. <br><br>So keep that in mind Johnny and to all of Railroad Earth. Although being on the road and being away from your families may be a burden to you sometimes, there are so many lives you have just made happier as you touched their souls from performances like these. 2009 has showcased some incredible strides on where Railroad Earth can truly take an audience as you all have touched the spiritual plane time and time again. These fans, new and old, have witnessed that and want to participate more and more to help you all escalate to those next levels of enlightenment.

I just didn&#39;t want to believe it. <BR><BR>I became a huge fan of the music of Railroad Earth before you came up here to play. Carey, Todd, Tim, Andy and Skehan just didn&#39;t know what was really happening here in the beginning. As we became friends, their minds slowly started changing and they saw that something was brewing with this band. In my eyes, there was something special going on. Something that was really going to be great. It was not until you came up here to Jersey that things gelled together. It was just missing one thing brother and that was you. <BR><BR>I didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t till this day just see you as a member of Railroad Earth. As each day, each month, each year passed, we got to know each other better and better. You really are a special person buddie who has set his mind to keep growing and moving in the paths of which you feel inherently in your soul and heart. That is a wonderful trait to have. Keep that spirit as it will be the driving force to keep moving you to better things. <BR><BR>Johnny, you see to me you are not only a bass player to this band. You are not only a musician that was just playing in a venue. You brought alot of heart and soul into this band. You infused some new youthful energy that in turn showcased on stage. As soon as you arrived up here in Jersey, you were treated as part of this family. We wanted to make sure that this something special that was going on here kept on going without losing a beat. I was not part of the whole beginning of the Grateful Dead movement. But in reading alot of the stuff that went on and hearing stories, the RRE experience is very akin to that same birth and growth. The music it moved us and still does to this day. You made an effort to become part of that movement, to become part of this family, to become part of this whole thing that we love so dearly. In doing so, you let yourself open up to a whole new experience that brought love, joy, laughter not only to yourself but to those that surround you. You connected to alot of people here in this great Hobo Family. You made yourself a staple in the community. Those are hard things to do for some folks. But you did it and to me it is one of the things that made this Hobo Family what it is today. It became a shared experience, band and fan alike. One big family. <BR><BR>We haved alot of great experiences together throughout this country. From all these great times here in Jersey, from you being at Ronquillo Ranch, to the Happy Brigade, to all points in between. These will be memories I will cherish for a life time. I have travelled near and have travelled far with you my friend. And although you have now decided to change your path, I will still be there walking beside you as our pathways have not divided. As it has been in the past as it will be in the future, I will always be there for you buddie, whenever you need help, whenever you need a friend to chat with, whenever you need to just have a beer and chill out. You know you can count on me Johnny. From my point of view, this ain&#39;t goodbye.

And besides you said the music \"business\" not just the music itself... <br><br>Anyways, it is an interesting and not exactly surprising parallel.  Music is built on code and follows structure, rules, and platforms the same way software does.  It also employs tools, faces distribution and copyright/licensing issues, creative engagement, fans, superfans, misuse, etc. etc.  Sometimes it&#39;s the creative performer that is defining the platform, sometimes it&#39;s the consumer, and often times it&#39;s a little of both.  You get the analogies...<br><br>So, my answer to the thought is, the music business is already a bit of a mix of open source and sequestered stuff along with the slippery slope that is Apple and how they are handling the proprietary nature of their \"derivative\" Unix platform.  Imagine if the Dead said, alright you can go out and play any of our tunes, but it&#39;s gotta be in either this or that venue, with only one of these engineers, and you&#39;ve got to use only our instrumentation. I don&#39;t want to hear that someone did \"Truckin&#39;\" on an ocarina. Oh and we get 30% of your net. <br><br>What you describe in your last paragraph sounds a lot like what MySpace had in mind in the first place - basically a single common platform for promoting and distributing music info albeit on THEIR platform.  There were so many great directions they could have gone with it including breaking the iTunes \"seminopoly\" but they kinda failed at that.  The thing about a common platform, even if it is open source, is that more often than not, getting it sustained still requires a lot of money and someone big to back it up and keep it running until all these little projects can have life.  That&#39;s how it worked with Unix and Bell labs.  <br><br>And that&#39;s also part of what I find so cool about Drupal and how that&#39;s actually kinda proving the exception to that rule but how likely will it win out as a very common and interchangeable platform in the end?  Honestly, I don&#39;t know but we&#39;ve already seen some \"flavors\" of it like Pressflow, OpenAtrium, and DrupalGardens, that some are making money off of consulting and developing for.  How long until someone sees the true value (if they&#39;re not already working on it) in creating an enterprise flavor and goes out making huge corporate web sites with it. Oh wait, Warner Bros. has already been doing something like that with their music site.  <br><br>As a musician, I liken some of the things that I do akin to being a developer too.  I can use \"Dreamweaver:Protools\" but I can also get a great product with \"Eclipse:Audacity\" (OK not 100% equivalent).  The thing is about getting a great product out there in the end.  I too hate the idea of posting the same shit about dates to MySpace, Facebook, and the band website.  Like 5 years ago, I played with Eventful since it would put out an RSS feed of your event/gig and thought it was a really cool way to centralize that effort but it&#39;s never gotten widely adopted.  Wish it would&#39;ve because it wouldn&#39;t be that challenging for FB/MS to pick that feed in but those guys are walled gardens and don&#39;t want to API out to everywhere.  The most they would ever let you do is feed to your wall. <br><br>One thing that I&#39;m appreciating more and more about open source licensing and the idea of carrying that over to the music biz is that there&#39;s less potential for people trying to screw you and change the rules after you&#39;re in as we&#39;re witnessing more with the Apple/Adobe debacle and Facebook&#39;s privacy issues.

Last night I dropped by and saw that I had a bevy of comments on this post that I didn\'t even know about.  \r\n\r\nThe thing I don\'t like about Drupal is that you have to tell it to do <em>everything</em>.  Not just that, but it\'s usually a three step process to tell it to do something simple like send me an email when someone leaves a comment.  You actually have to enable two modules and then set them up just to get it to send an email telling me to check my site.  Anyway...\r\n\r\nAnd Ron, FWIW, I went to the NYC DrupalCamp about a month ago and the absolute best presentation I went to was called \"<a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/75548\">Wordpress is Better than Drupal</a>\".  I guess this room full of mostly Drupal devs had never really used WP before.  It convinced me to start a project that I was over a month into in WP.  Point being, there is a lot that Drupal is totally clueless about, almost all of it in the User Experience category.\r\n\r\nI\'ll write up a post about migrating a site.

My main reason for messing with Drupal is to see if it\'s better for Calendar management and  onsite search. I\'m not much of a WP plugin fan. I\'d rather edit my theme php. But when budget strikes plugins make for easy work arounds. I figure if I can learn enough about setting up Drupal and massaging good design into it, some of the modules might make for better end results. \r\n\r\nYou hit it on the head with User Experience. It\'s one reason the iPhone is so popular.

Most of it is out there, but it\'s not quite as simple as moving a WP install.  A BIG help while you\'re developing a Drupal site locally in MAMP is if you get VHosts setup.  That lets you set the root of the site to a http://root-URL instead of http://localhost:8888/one-level-removed.  That was a big hurdle for me to clear, because then you can really set relative URLs in your content without it messing up on your staging server.  Fer instance, if you have all images stored in the /images folder, with a default MAMP setup the images will actually be in localhost:8888/yer-site/images, rather than yer-site/images.  However, if you use relative URLs in your stylesheets or whatever to pull those images, /images will pull from localhost:8888/images, which of course doesn\'t exists.  this should have been a blog post...\r\n\r\nAnyway, on Drupal search - check out the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/luceneapi\">Lucene module</a>.  Drupal\'s default search is a\'ight, but it seems to leave folks wanting.\r\n\r\nOn Drupal theming, it\'s very similar to WP theming, but you\'ve probably figured that out already.  If you can see the correlations - template.php in D6, functions.php in WP - you\'ll be in good shape.\r\n\r\nOn Drupal v WP user Experience, it\'s pretty obvious that Drupal is for developers by developers.  Wordpress is easy to use for almost anyone, and since many webhosts have automatic installers it\'s pretty much a no-brainer.  Not so for Drupal though.\r\n\r\nI\'m actually really digging WP lately, mostly due to the fact that Drupal has forced me to get familiar with a lot of actually programming/hacking.  The paradigm with modules/plugins latching on to hooks is the pretty much the same in both.  Drupal just gives you a lot more out of the box, at the cost of a lot of complexity of setup.\r\n\r\nWish I had time to write as much as I want, but duty calls...','71.53.2.172','1283346950','0','1','07.00/','jgrubb','therealjohnnygrubb@gmail.com','');

Luckily it\'s just an error.','67.239.234.15','1287447002','0','2','09/','jgrubb','therealjohnnygrubb@gmail.com',''),('404','0','154','0','jgrubb you are my hero! thank','jgrubb you are my hero! thank you so much for this! i have set up drush a few times on different servers and it always takes FOREVER (I really don\'t know what i\'m doing with a command line) and I have to try to re-learn every time I need it again.

First, the old way:<div><br /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>The old way involved the \"record industry\".  The record industry used to exist because recording was very expensive.  It was expensive to record a song, it was expensive to reproduce the recording of the song, and it was really expensive to warehouse, distribute, and sell the recording of that song.  Thus a whole industry cropped up to take advantage of the fact that the barrier to entry for your average recording artist, say Ma Carter out of the hills around Bristol VA, was so astronomically high that nobody really thought about releasing their own music.  Show up, play my tunes, get paid for them?  Okay!  This worked great for long enough for the basic oligarchic framework of the major label system to rise to power.</div><div><br /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>A moment now to reflect.  It\'s extremely popular to bash record labels, and with good reason.  Let us now take a moment, however, to reflect on the cultural purpose that they\'ve served...</div><div><br /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>I take it for granted that America is, on balance, the coolest nation on the face of the earth, in the history of humanity.  Citizens from other countries would doubtless dispute this claim, but I would submit to you that even those societies that profess to hate everything America stands for only  hate so strongly because they don\'t enjoy the liberties and luxuries that Americans have long grown accustomed to.  Now, imagine if the record business never existed, that there was no such thing as an LP or a CD, and the only way to enjoy music was to go listen to it live.  There were no Beatles, except for those of you lucky enough to be in the Cavern Club, no Elvis, unless you went down to the BBQ shack to see him in Memphis, no Chuck Berry, no Led Zeppelin, no Pink Floyd, no Eagles, no Neil Young, no Bob Dylan, no Coldplay, no U2.  I know, a lot of these bands are from the UK, but I consider the give and take of the UK and the USA to be part of the competitive exchange that has pushed the limits of musical creativity for the better.  And we can safely lump all these bands into the category of Western Music.  Now, imagine if Western Music never existed.  How would we export our culture abroad?  At gunpoint, probably.  How would generations of kids be incited to stand up and make change happen?  At gunpoint, probably.  My point is that exactly at the moment in human events that the USA and the UK became 2 of the dominant political powers in the world (1946 or so), rock and roll made an appearance.  It moved legions of Japanese kids just like it did American kids.  The cultural service that the major label system provided these kids and us to come later is therefore immeasurable.  And the world danced together...</div>\r\n\r\n<div><br /></div><div>Now, back to the point, to be covered in another blog, because really long blogs are fucking boring...</div>','Now, this part won\'t be any news to anyone, but will mainly serve to help organize the thoughts in my brain.

My technical history, in essay form...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m originally from Atlanta GA.  <a href=\"http://woodward.edu\">Privately educated</a> there and went on to get a degree in Recording and Production from <a href=\"http://www.appstate.edu/\">Appalachian State University</a> in North Carolina.  The recording degree was kinda silly in hindsight, though the last two Railroad Earth records wouldn\'t have gotten done without my building the studio, twice, from scratch.  I have a pretty extensive background in all forms of recording and digital production, as well as being pretty familiar with the electronic engineering aspect of both analog and digital studio gear.  I solder.  I know how an LA-2 works, versus an 1176.  I know the difference between a 12AX7 and a 12AY7, and can explain why 24 bits are better than 16.  I spent a few years in the van with the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sound-Reinforcement-Handbook-Gary-Davis/dp/0881889008/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255648654&sr=8-1\">Yamaha Live Sound</a> book, which instilled an interest in electronic engineering, until it clicked in my head that building boutique recording gear and amps wasn\'t really a growth industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 2 years ago I got an iPhone.  My story wouldn\'t be complete without mentioning this detail.  That\'s when the possibilities of the software and internet sector and the emerging mobile market began to dawn on me.  Now, there\'s a growth industry.  So anyway, once Apple opened up the phone to outside developers I dove in, bought a Mac and started teaching myself programming.  I focused obsessively on iPhone programming for the first six months or so and during this period began to get up to speed on modern programming concepts.  Around the turn of the year last year I began brainstorming a suite of products and services geared specifically toward the artist end of the music business, and even more specifically at <a hef=\"http://railroadearth.com\">my band</a>.  This is when I began poking around at web development, going through the various languages, toolkits, and frameworks available to the modern web developer.  I\'d begun making some connections in the software and tech startup sector and knew where to find answers to my questions by this point.  I set up this blog on the advice of one of the tech blogs I read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus began in earnest my self-education in web development.  My curiosity outgrew the Google Blogger site in a few weeks and I moved over to a self-hosted Wordpress system.  This was April or so, this year.  Thus began my self-education in web hosting and <a hef=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">CMS</a> (content management system) installation, customization, and maintenance.  Still working on my bigger vision I stumbled across both <a href=\"http://drupal.org/\">Drupal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.joomla.org/\">Joomla</a> - two popular CMSs - and realized that plenty of people had had the same idea that I\'d had - that it shouldn\'t be so difficult for the layman to achieve a web presence.  All of these systems are written in PHP, which is an almost universally available web programming language, so thus began my education in coding PHP.  The nice thing about all of these CMSs is that they\'ve all been in wide use by many programmers for years now, and they are flexible and extensible by the nature of being open-source.  Pretty much any customization that you can think of and certainly the most common ones have been done a million times by this point, so my lack of a CS degree doesn\'t prohibit me, or anyone for that matter, from achieving detailed levels of customization in a matter of days rather than weeks.  Not to mention, the best way for me to learn is to follow the paths that others have already created, so hacking at WordPress and Drupal has been a lot of fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August I began a rebuild of my band\'s site.  I\'m not a designer, and RRE doesn\'t seem to have the financial resources available to hire one, but I did my best.  All of the various features on the different pages are simple custom functions that I wrote to output different HTML depending on which page was requested.  Our search traffic went up 3500% the day I switched the site, and our overall traffic is up 50% since then.  WordPress is a great CMS for a relatively straightforward site, and it couldn\'t be easier for a client to maintain the content.  For more complex sites, the Drupal framework is about as good as it gets to me.  The server-side installation is a piece of cake and the customization with whatever features the client wants is generally a fairly straightforward process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>=>What I lack disclaimer => is much experience with JavaScript, which is the client side programming language that achieves all those fancy visual effects on some of the sites out there.  JavaScript is what makes things fly around the page when you mouse over them and what animates drop-down menus and all that.  I know how to learn it, though, and there are JS frameworks out there to achieve many tasks, and I have <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Book-JavaScript-2nd-Practical-Interactive/dp/1593271069/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255648972&sr=8-1\">a great JS book</a>, but that is a gap in my skill set at this point.  -> end disclaimer </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<a href=\"http://card.ly/jgrubb\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/vcard-blue-big.png\" alt=\"card.ly\" /></a>','<p>I\'ve never had to write a resume for myself before, and I really would rather just write than spend the time hacking around in the resume templates on Word, so here goes.

But first, I should probably introduce myself, or do a bio, or something.  Maybe this will take several parts, because I\'ve never tried to write a bio, and I feel like I\'ve done a good job living unconventionally with my first 30 years here...<br /><br />   I was born in ATL, Georgia, that is.  No brothers or sisters.  Great parents.  Always totally behind me for some reason.  I got pretty mediocre grades at the private school they sent me to, and spent most of my time getting in trouble.  Nothing big ever, no real cause for concern, I just didn\'t really feel like fitting into their mold over there.  I realize now in hindsight that I left high school with pretty low self esteem after being told for half of my life what an underachiever I was, how much potential I had that if I just \"applied myself\".  I had some really good friends, though, and at some point found music. <br /><br />   I\'d been in the school band since 6th grade, trombone.  I realize now that I never knew how to read music.  I think I learned the parts by listening to whomever I was sitting next to.  That amazes me in hindsight, but nobody picked up on it, least of all me.  I was that into the trombone anyway, I was much more into the drums.  I used to get on my band directors nerve because as soon as we got into the room I\'d be back in the percussion section, not learning the trombone parts. <br /><br />   \"Why didn\'t you just switch to percussion?\"  you might ask..<br /><br />   \"Because we need trombones\" was the answer I got for years and years whenever I asked to switch to percussion.<br /><br />    There was one time that I was really into building model planes.  I didn\'t use plastic cement, for some reason I used a hot glue gun.  It was messy and my models turned out looking like crap, but that\'s not the point.  One time I\'d set my glue gun down, with it pointing into my glass of water.  It had dripped some hot glue into the glass, apparently, right before I took a sip.  I burned the crap out of my top lip and had a huge ugly scab for weeks.  The band concert was coming up that week.  I couldn\'t play the trombone.  I got to be a percussionist for a week.  It was like heaven.  I couldn\'t read music for the bass drum either, but I damn sure could make the part up.  Nobody ever knew, and I never told them.  I totally forgot about that until now.<br /><br />   Anyway, I forget why, but at some point I got more or less kicked out of the band.  I think I skipped a mandatory concert to go on a youth group trip with my church.  I asked them if I could skip the concert to go on a youth group trip and they said \"no\".  This would\'ve been a reasonable answer, except that five minutes before my best friends James had asked them if he could go on the exact same trip that I was asking to go on, and they told him \"sure\".  So I went anyway.  Now I remember why.  Amazing this blogging...<br /><br />   Anyway, now I\'m in a band, and right now I\'m on a tour bus heading to the GA theater in Athens.  I\'ve got some time to kill, so I\'ll keep catching you up, whoever you are.  At this rate, I\'ll get to my big idea in another 20 posts or so.','To speak into the void.<br /><br />  So I\'ve had this idea simmering on the front burner of my brain for several months now.

I\'ve been in the band for 6.  When I first joined the band we were buying a van from a liquor store parking lot so that we could get around the country more comfortably and reliably.  That van turned 300,ooo miles last weekend.  We played Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire.  In February.  \"This is ridiculous\" we thought to ourselves.  Yet, we sold out the little place we played in ME, and the huge place we played in VT.  Turns out cabin fever is a good thing for your band.  But we do this all the time.<br /><br />   You take your average artist that\'s on a major label, that\'s on the radio or MTV, and we draw more people to any given show in any given town than probably 90% of them.  That there\'s something going on here is plain for anyone to see.  That we\'re impossible to \"market\" in the traditional sense, in the traditional way is equally plain, to me at least.  I don\'t even know how to answer the question \"What kind of music do you guys play?\" and I\'ve been looking for a straight reply for 6 years.  So I don\'t get frustrated when we put out a new record and it doesn\'t sell, or get the media response that I\'m sure it\'ll get, or when the good radio play we\'re actually getting for the first time doesn\'t actualy translate into any hard numbers.  Okay, so I do, but does it really matter?  If you\'re a fan of RRE, how did you find RRE?  Was it seeing an article in the paper, or a magazine?  Was it by hearing us on XM/Sirius?<br /><br />   It may have been, but I\'d say chances are pretty strong that either one of your friends turned you on to us, or that you stumbled across us on the internet.

I hadn\'t exercised regularly since college, where they gave you gym access along with your tuition.  I spent the rest of my 20s gaining about 2 or 3 pounds a year, and not really doing much in the way of taking care of myself.  It had occurred to me that the only exercise I was really ever going to be able to afford was running, but I <i>hate</i> running.  I kept up this hope that some day I was going to be able to at least join a YMCA with a pool or something, as that was much more my speed.<div>    I had a big winter last year, with the birth of my baby boy right in the middle of it.  I had the same realization that I had had in college 11 years earlier - that one simple little thing that I could that would make me feel better was to start getting some regular exercise again.  So I dug my running shoes out of the closet, as I had tried this before, and got started.  The first mile isn\'t as hard as the second mile.  And it must\'ve taken me six months of plugging away at just running those two miles without stopping, but once I got over the hump, I really got over the hump.</div><div>    My short run around where I live is right at 4 miles long, and I try to do that every other day when the weather allows.  I start getting really antsy if I go more than a week.  Without a shadow of a doubt, I\'m in the best shape I\'ve ever been in.  I lost the pounds and then some, and haven\'t really relapsed at all as far as bad eating habits.  My wife Michelle is a veg, so it\'s easy when I\'m home, but I\'ve managed to keep at it on the road with greater and greater success.  I got up yesterday at 7:30 and went for about 3.5 with my buddy Matt, and then did another 3 or so here in Charleston.  As you can tell, this is about nothing in particular, but if you hate running as bad as I did, there\'s a very good chance that you could love it as much as I do now...</div>','I started running about this time last year.

For those of you who have never been signed to a record contract, they are shadier (pardon the pun) than you probably imagine.  The whole point of getting a record deal is to try and make some money off of selling your recording, right?  Well, over the last decades, the industry (and by industry, I mean the lawyers and label heads in charge of finding ever more inventive ways of scamming inattentive rock stars (which is generally easier than shooting fish in a barrel)) has come up with some novel ideas about how your royalty rate should be calculated.  They subtract the cost of all manner of promotional charges for the posters you see in the window of the record store, and then things like \"breakage\" (which hasn\'t been a real issue since records were made of shellac), and then just arbitrarily lop off another 10% for this, and 10% for that, until by the end you\'re not getting paid for the 1 million records you sold, you\'re getting paid for maybe 500k of them, if you\'re very lucky.  Then they charge you back for some more (usually bogus) stuff.  The whole game is to keep you, the artist, in the hole.  It\'s easy.  Oh, the label is sending a limo to pick you up at the airport and take you to the Grammy\'s!  Great!  Do I need to tip the driver?<div><br /></div><div>Add into this that their lawyers have seen fit to jump on digital distribution by making your royalty rate 75% (again, if you\'re lucky) of what it would be if there were a physical medium being sold through a store (and this is in addition to subtracting for \"Breakage\", etc.), and the margins for the artist get even lower.  It\'s pathetic, honestly.  Even more pathetic is that artists are usually in a big hurry to sign these pieces of shit.  </div><div><br /></div><div>So, when I read things like <a href=\"http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20090309/that-tiny-sum-its-your-digital-download-royalties-after-packaging-costs-and-breakage/\">this</a>, it really makes me wonder.  To sum up, Em\'s old producers sued over the fact that there were so many absurdly non-justifiable, pre-royalty charges added up before they got their cut.  They argue, and rightly so in my mind, that since you can\'t \"break\" a digital download, and the distribution costs are virtually nil, and that the labels aren\'t paying for in-store promotional material to market the download, that those charges shouldn\'t apply to their royalties.  They argued that the deals should work more like commercial and movie licensing agreements work.  That\'d bring their cut up, as producers.  It\'d also bring down the labels\' cut, obviously.  The jury found for Universal, unfortunately...</div><div><br /></div><div>So when I read articles like the <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/EELkxo88_yI/\">one that I posted earlier today</a>, I wonder why music label execs think we\'re all so stupid.  By \"we\", I don\'t just mean artists because there\'s plenty of empirical evidence that we are in fact, but the entire music listening populace.

They wanted to be able to do hold music or messaging for their clients for whom they provide an answering service.  It went well.  Spending other peoples money on recording gear and computers is the perfect job for me, but alas, they only needed one system to get the job done.

Their network guy is completely swamped at this place, so I\'ve been learning a lot from him about Windows networking.  This is what has kept me away from the computer for 2 weeks now.

He saw my big PHP book and started asking me about what I was doing, so that pretty much filled up the 20 minute cab ride.  <div><br /></div><div>Last night\'s show was kinda just alright for me, personally.  It\'s funny because Phil and Stacy both thought it was the best show of the weekend.  It\'s just goes to show, you never know.  I\'ve learned through the years (you never let me down..) that I have absolutely the most subjective opinion about the quality of any given show of anyone in the listening world.  It\'s the double edge sword that keeps us from putting out more LiveDownloads.  Typically for me, the quality of the experience that I have on any given night is directly proportional to the frequency distribution between 40 and 150 Hz in the location on the stage at which I\'m standing.  That\'s a pretty specific requirement, but last night it just wasn\'t that happening.  The theater we were playing in last night was Very Big.  Very Big means a lot of air that you have to get moving before the entire room starts to feel right, which is what makes it sound good between 40-150 Hz wherever I am on stage.  </div><div><br /></div><div>I suppose that we probably wouldn\'t be as subject to the peculiarities of a given rooms acoustics if we were a more electric band.  Let\'s just take my bass for example.  My bass is a giant wood box that\'s designed to resonate.  I stand next to a drum set.  If you were to solo up the signal from my DI during a show and listen to what is making my bass resonate, you\'d hear the notes I\'m playing, but also the kick drum loud and clear.  You hear a good bit of fiddle, or God forbid the electric guitar, and the rest of the stage, muffled.  This makes my bass essentially the biggest microphone on the stage, with a frequency response that tapers off at about 100 Hz.</div><div><br /></div><div>What this means to me is that if the room is shaped just so, and you never know until you start playing, there\'s the possibility of a \'standing wave\' on certain notes.  A standing wave is one that has a wavelength that\'s some multiple of the dimensions of the stage we\'re playing.  Suppose I play an open D.  Suppose that D vibrates at a frequency of 65 Hz.  That means that 65 times every second that string is going to return to more or less the same place in space on my bass (nice).  While that string is vibrating it\'s sending a signal to my amp and to Mikey out in front.  That string is going to cause air to be pushed out of the speakers 65 times a second.  The air being pushed out of those speakers is going to travel at the speed of sound and bounce off of hard surfaces and dancing bodies alike.  The hard surfaces reflect the sound much better, and those soundwaves bounce off and travel back toward me.  Meanwhile, other soundwaves have been continuing to come out of my amp and the PA.  If the note that I\'m playing at the time lines up in a certain reinforcing way with the note that\'s bouncing back toward me from the wall and the PA, you get a standing wave.  That\'s when feedback begins, and my night starts to go downhill.</div><div><br /></div><div>Other nights it\'s the exact opposite, and the note that\'s bouncing off the wall is totally out of sync with the note that I\'m playing at the time.  That\'s when you get \'phase cancellation\', which means that the soundwaves are canceling each other out.  That\'s even worse than a standing wave for me, because then there\'s really no balls to the sound.  Phase cancellation is what makes outdoor concerts sound weird when the wind is blowing and you\'re about 100 yards away from the stage and the sound kinda shifts around and sounds, well, phasey..</div><div><br /></div><div>And then some nights, the PA and the amp and my bass are all playing nice with each other and you get that nice even low end.  A nice even low end means ceasing to consider the sound and actually listening to what my bandmates are playing.  That\'s a good night.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then some nights, the PA and the amp and my bass are all playing nice with each other, but we still can\'t get it sounding right.  That was last night.  It usually happens in a Big Room because the Big Room swallows sound waves and doesn\'t let them come back to you in time to be useful.  It sends them back to you much later so that it sounds like a delay on your entire band being blasted back at you.</div><div><br /></div><div>And then some nights the sound is so God awful that you just say fuck it, and those are usually really great nights.  Blacksburg was one of those.  It was in a tiny little basement of a club, my bass was acting up all night, but the crowd was blazing.  You can\'t possibly have a bad time in that situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now boarding.

The difference between how you think and speak and interact, and how your computer does.  The difference between languages, be they interpreted or compiled, object oriented or procedural.  This first chapter will hopefully assist in the process of the first few days after the moment where it first occurs to you that you want to learn how to develop software, be they games or business or iPhone apps.  The real difference for me was the the one between what I thought the process was going to be and what it\'s actually turned out to be.\r\n\r\nThe moment occurred for me in a car.  I had bought an iPhone a few months after it first came out.  It was the first such early adopter move that I\'d made, technologically speaking.  I knew as soon as I started screwing around with it that this was a tool that could really help you get your life organized, something that I\'d managed to get around doing for the previous 30 years.  All of the built in applications that Apple provided for their first tier of users were most helpful in that task - email everywhere, calendar, internet, maps, oh yeah, and a phone.  The real fun didn\'t begin for me until they (Apple) released the 2.0 software update.  This was the update that heralded the opening of the AppStore, where there were now hundreds of apps available from 3rd party developers that could extend the usefulness of your phone.  Anyway, to make a long story no less long, the first long car ride I took after updating my phone was the one where the <em>real</em> potential of mobile computing dawned on me.\r\n\r\nI came home that weekend determined to figure out what it would take to learn the art and craft of building my own applications, as this was clearly a vast and uncharted territory for creative people to make things that could affect the lives of huge numbers of people (and maybe even make a living doing it).\r\n\r\nI got home that week and started Googling.  A search on Computer Programming turned up a mountain of information that was so staggeringly huge as to be almost useless.  I did learn a few things - Wikipedia can be your best friend; there are many different ways to program computers; there are endless amounts of information on programming computers, most of it written by computer programmers with no conversational or literary ability whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI was able to discern a few important pieces, however.  One was something called \"compilation\".  I wasn\'t sure what this was or why it was important, but hey.  Another was that if you\'re going to develop software, and you\'re used to working in a more or less standard Windows environment, you\'re in for a ride.  Another was that there was something called Object Oriented programming, that supposedly is some kind of elevated way to program.  iPhone apps are written in an OO manner.  Oh, and if you really want to develop apps for the iPhone, you have to buy a Mac.  That\'s some clever marketing, and the push over the cliff that I\'d been waiting for for years.  The bonus was that once you bought the Mac, all of the tools to develop apps, as well as an enormous user community was there to help, for free.

INSERT INTO `node_revisions` VALUES ('30','30','1','Chapter1b','<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: bold; \">Step 2. Learn to program</span></div><br />Here\'s the thing. Computers don\'t think like you and me. They think in 1s and 0s. Every programming language ever invented has basically been a way to translate what a human wants to have done into a stream of 1s and 0s to be read by the computer. The translation into binary can happen at a couple of different points along the way from programmers head to users computer screen, but there are basically two different methods for how different languages do this. Some languages, especially the older (pre-1990) ones are \"compiled\". That\'s a really byzantine process that basically involves taking the code that you have written, translating it into some 1s and os, linking it with other files in your code, and wrapping it up into an \"executable\" - a program that you can execute on your computer or whatever. The advantages of this method are thus:<br /><br />Some larger applications can have bazillions of lines of code to execute (think about a Windows installer disk). If all of these lines of code were translated into binary at the time you run the application, the app would run so slowly that it\'d be useless. This was obviously a big deal before CPU speeds got to be what they are now. Back in the day, the act of compiling was in itself a very time consuming procedure, and still can be today, so by doing it beforehand you save that much time and effort on the part of your computer. You also have the advantage of tuning your application on a lower level with regards to interaction with the Operating System (we\'ll get to that), thus making it possible for your app to perform much more nimbly. So basically, most of the benefits of compiled languages are in the performance arena.<br /><br />The disadvantages of compiled languages have mostly to do with portability. Since the code has already been bundled into binary, the only machine on which the executable will run is the one for which it was written. That\'s why you have Mac and PC versions of the same software on the shelves. They had to be written and compiled separately since the two different computers have different methods of operating at the OS level and thus need different sets of instructions to accomplish the same task. C is the mother language from which virtually all other languages are descended, and the perfect example of a compiled language. iPhone apps are written in a language called Objective-C, descended from C with an OO twist. Since iPhone apps are written for one device and one device only, and since application performance on a phone really matters (think battery life), compilation makes perfect sense.<br /><br />The other side of the coin, and I\'ve been looking for this side for a while and have only recently found it, is an \"interpreted\" language. HTML is the perfect example of an interpreted language. HTML is only lines of code, just like an iPhone app or the Windows executable. The difference is that you leave the code alone and don\'t compile it. The code is instead \"interpreted\" at the time it\'s run, in the case of HTML by the browser that you\'re working in. The pros and cons of interpreted languages are exactly the opposite of compiled languages. You only write the code once and it works for every machine out there. It\'s left alone until that particular section of code is needed at \"runtime\", at which point whatever is doing the interpreting, be it the browser or the server on the other end, crunches your code into binary and spits it out into whatever the application needs at the time. As computers have gotten more and more powerful, this method seems to be gaining a lot of traction as the preferred method of writing new applications. Some examples are JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby - languages that get chewed up into something actionable at runtime. In the case of Ruby on Rails, which is the hot-shit dev platform at the time of this writing, the code actually gets interpreted twice - once on the server side where the code is translated into HTML, and again on the browser side when the HTML is translated into something that you can read and work with.<br /><br />Twitter was originally written with Ruby on Rails. If you think about it, Twitter is just an application that communicates over the internet. It really only does that one thing. They don\'t even display advertising (yet). Many of the traditional features of a commercial website are not there, so why write it in HTML? Especially when you have this vast database of information that gets displayed uniquely on every different computer screen out there, it\'s a perfect solution. Parts of Facebook are written with PHP, another interpreted language. PHP is designed to interact with info in a database - users and their profiles, pictures, text, whatever - and to write the HTML to display that info on the fly at the time of the page request.<br /><br />Pretty cool, huh?

When I picture heaven in my head, it looks more or less like what I remember the drive from Banner Elk to Boone along 105 looking like - Grandfather Mountain, the old Gold Mine tourist joint in Foscoe, Hawk\'s Nest ski area where I used to be a lift operator, that sandwich place on the corner of the turn to Valle Cruces, the leaves in the fall, the walk up Howard\'s Knob, hiking up Table Rock in the middle of the night to see the most beautiful sunrise a few hours later. I get goosebumps thinking about it.\r\n\r\nFor some reason I\'ve been thinking about that drive a lot the past two days. I wonder what it looks like now. There used to be this rock quarry at the top of the hill as you were leaving Boone toward Foscoe, at the corner of the 105 bypass. I was cleaning up my yard this week and I remembered driving past that quarry probably 8 or 9 years ago. This was just as I was getting into DJing in college. I didn\'t go to Phish shows in college like all of my friends did. The String Cheese Incident was just starting to get really big about the time that I graduated. Instead I got into the whole Electronic/DJ/Rave scene in the late 90s. This was before kids started sneaking out of the house and getting themselves killed ingesting drugs meant to put Fido to sleep at the vet, in a golden year-long period where the rave scene in NC was exactly where I wanted to be. I spent my time driving to big parties all over the SE to go see DJ Icey, Dieselboy, Sasha and John Digweed, Jimmy Van M, Simply Jeff, Scott and Robbie Hardkiss, DJ Keoki, Donald Glaude, DJ Dara...\r\n\r\nI went to this one party in my hometown of ATL one time. The headliners were Simply Jeff and DJ Icey and Dieselboy. There was a point earlier in the night where I was dancing my ass off and I noticed that there was this circle around me of people watching. It was weird because I wasn\'t paying any attention to anything other than the basslines coming out of the system courtesy of Mr. Icey. I still remember this one record he played that night - the vocal hook was \"can you feel the BASS\", and when the record said \'bass\' there was this note that came out of the subs that can\'t be related verbally. It shook the world. It made my hair stand up. It made the entire party, all 5000 of us, stop dancing and look around at each other. Yes, we could feel the bass. Oh my God, could we feel it...\r\n\r\nLater in the night I found myself up on this stairway platform looking out at the whole crowd rippling like a flag blowing in the breeze. I came down the stairs and some girl walks by with a backpack full of glowsticks. I said it was the late 90s, didn\'t I? I guess this girl was part of what I now know as the \'ambiance crew\'. I\'d never seen her before, but she walks by me and pulls out a glowstick and cracks it open and hands it to me. I still have that glowstick. That glowstick was the light bulb that went on in my head at the moment that I looked around and noticed 5000 people dancing in unison to 1 guy\'s music. 1 guy hidden in some corner of that place had this entire party under his spell. 1 guy was responsible for guiding this entire party and making them get down like they\'d never gotten down before in their lives.

When I picture heaven in my head, it looks more or less like what I remember the drive from Banner Elk to Boone along 105 looking like - Grandfather Mountain, the old Gold Mine tourist joint in Foscoe, Hawk\'s Nest ski area where I used to be a lift operator, that sandwich place on the corner of the turn to Valle Cruces, the leaves in the fall, the walk up Howard\'s Knob, hiking up Table Rock in the middle of the night to see the most beautiful sunrise a few hours later.','','1277343710','2');

 If someone wants hard facts and a professionally written tutorial on computer science, they\'d probably go somewhere else.  If they\'re here, they\'re either a friend or an understanding onlooker, and either way they\'re probably well aware that you\'re just a bass player.  Nobody really expects that much from the bass player.\"  So, I\'m on I 70 headed east across Kansas after selling the <em>shit </em>out of the Ogden theater this weekend.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my initial impressions on the theory and practice of the database.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is a database?  Being a visual kind of thinker, I\'ve been trying to come up with some sort of relatable analogy to help myself understand exactly what it is.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s a series of tables, populated with data, and the tables relate to each other.\"\r\n\r\nOkay.  What do you do with it?\r\n\r\n\"Well, once you have the data in your database, you can run queries on it.\"\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a lot of fun!  But what the hell does that mean?\r\n\r\n\"Well, queries are like a request that you make.  Say you have a database that\'s populated with every song that RRE has ever played at every show in every venue.  If you wanted to know what you played at a given venue the previous time that you were there, then you could query the database to give you the set list from that show.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that\'s cool.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but say you wanted to know how many times you\'ve played Mighty River.  You could query the same database and get an answer on that, too.  Say you wanted to know the venues where you played it.  You could query that, too.\"\r\n\r\nOkay, I get it.  So a database is kind of like a big spreadsheet?\r\n\r\n\"Sort of, but not really.  You see a spreadsheet is basically one big monolithic sheet that stores your data in rows and columns; like a database, but a database is made up of many of those sheets, and the collection of those sheets and the way that they relate to each other, and the queries that you can then make of the data is what makes it a more useful tool than just a big sheet with some numbers on it.\"\r\n\r\nOkay.  So, how about an example?\r\n\r\nFor this, we shall turn to the web.  Actually, never mind because this is a blog which means that you don\'t need to turn at all.  Let\'s press Ctrl-T and get a fresh tab going in your browser and go on over to <a href=\"http://amazon.com\">Amazon</a>.  Mac users have the option of Cmd-clicking the link to open in a new browser tab, so you don\'t have to navigate away from me.\r\n\r\nOkay.  You see all that stuff on the page?  Just about everything there is stored in a big-ass database - all the text, all the ads, all the pictures.  Now, why is this important?  For that, we\'ll turn to my bookshelf and it\'s copy of <em>The Complete and Unabridged History of The Internet</em>.  I see here in chapter two after all this non-sense about universities and the DoD that once upon a time there was no such thing as the World Wide Web.  I\'ll skip to the part where then there was a WWW.  The first websites on the newborn baby web were mostly authored in straight HTML, an interpreted language used to help your computer assemble some data on the other end into a web page.  A skilled HTML coder can control every single element on the page that\'s being displayed down to the very pixel (until it\'s opened in another browser, but that\'s another chapter).  The HTML basically tells your browser what text to display, how to format it, what the background color ought to be, where to place the pictures and to what they should link.  This is understandably tedious and time consuming work, but you gotta do it if you want your website to look right.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way, websites started getting much more complex.  Some genius decided to make a big online store where you could get pretty much anything, from books to socks to computers to whatever.  Now, imagine if you will, the task of hand coding every page.  For every item and every view and every picture and every review there was some army of poor bastards on the other end furiously coding away to keep up with the inflow of new inventory/users/reviews.  I recently read about some guy who worked for an online newspaper, and he supposedly spent 14 hours a day coding HTML for the site before he figured out that there was a better way to get your steady flow of content up there.\r\n\r\nThe answer lies in scripting language and a database.\r\n\r\nA scripting language is basically the same thing as an interpreted language in as much as it\'s not compiled, or even thought of until \"runtime\".  At runtime, the computer gives instructions to something, probably your browser, which then passes the request along to the code.  It\'s at that time (runtime) that the code is crunched into the binary code that your computer can actually do something with on the processor level.  This is hyper-simplified.\r\n\r\nWhat this means in the Amazon example is that instead of hand-coding every page, why not just build a template that gets populated with the data that\'s requested at the time?  Then you don\'t have to rebuild the wheel every single time a page request is made.  Well, how do you build a template?  With a scripting language, of course!\r\n\r\nI\'ll just cut to the bird-eye view.  When you go to Amazon, and it knows that it\'s you, and it spits out all that stuff that you should buy based on past purchases, that\'s because all of that info is stored in a database.  When you click on an item and go to that items page, and the page looks just like the last one, that\'s because all that info is stored in a database.  There\'s a table in there for every one of you, and for every item on the site.  The table for you has all of your info in it, including past purchases, addresses, billing info, etc.  The table for each item has the description, pictures, reviews, links, etc.\r\n\r\nThe point is that each of these tables is filled out in a standard way with all of their pertinent data.  Why this is cool is that some automated process can then do something with it, like fill out a web page, or display your customer profile.  The scripting language is what automates the process.  It provides the instructions for the web server on the other end of your computer to \"dynamically\" make up the HTML needed to display the pictures and profile info and whatever else in a cohesive way across the entire website.  Dynamically means that you don\'t need an army of HTMLers because the computer is writing the HTML at the time of the page request.  Every different kind of page on the site (say reviews vs. the home page) has it\'s own scripted template that\'s called up when the appropriate request is made.  Kinda cool, no?\r\n\r\nSo, a database is somewhere between MS Excel and that big Tupperware bin where you keep all your summer clothes.  We\'ll dive into the beauty of doing things this way later.\r\n\r\nA few database driven websites:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3ARailroadEarth&amp;sort=-date\">Archive.org</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com\">Twitter</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/blog\">This blog</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://messageboard.tapeop.com/index.php?sid=d5ce53c0f1b60db5b462e65e841b6cfa\">Any message forum</a>\r\n\r\nExtra credit : Start paying attention to URLs, especially whenever the letters .php are used.  PHP is a very widely used scripting language for making database driven websites, and if .php is included somewhere on your address bar, you\'re looking at data that\'s stored in a database.','This part of the blog is going to be tough to write.  Not because I don\'t have much to say on the topic, but because I have frequent pangs of \"dude, you don\'t really know anything about any of this stuff\".  Then the other side of my brain speaks up. \"Dude, it\'s cool.  They know you\'re not a professor.  That\'s the point of this whole thing, right?  If someone wants hard facts and a professionally written tutorial on computer science, they\'d probably go somewhere else.','','1277343710','2');

one that started with a fairly significant library of code already put together to make the developers job that much quicker.  At some point, Apple was not doing well financially or otherwise and Microsoft came in and basically gave them a lifeline.  This was in the 90s.  Steve J at that point was an intensely innovative failure.  Funny, huh?\r\n\r\nAround this time Apple decided to buy NeXT computers along with the Operating System that they had developed.  Steve J was brought back as an advisor for a little bit before becoming CEO within a year.  The NeXT OS eventually became Mac OS X, which eventually became the iPhone OS.  The point is that even though the iPhone has only been around for less than 2 years now, the developmental lead-up took decades.  During that time, various developers decided that they would put together \'libraries\' of code for making Macintosh applications and save themselves the time of having to rewrite all this code that\'s essentially \"boilerplate\", meaning the same in every app, there to provide low level functionality that the end user never encounters and is very rarely altered even by the developer though widely varying apps are coming out the other end.  Every language that\'s in any kind of wide use has it\'s own set of libraries, there to provide standard functionality for the programmer and standard sets of instructions for the computer to execute when certain functions are called within the app.\r\n\r\nOkay, sorry.  There\'s a lot in there that I wouldn\'t have understood 9 months ago, so let me break it down for you.\r\n\r\nWhen you tell X Code to start a new project, it asks you what kind of project you\'d like to start.  It gives you the options of a couple of different layouts of iPhone apps.  Perhaps you\'d care to build a navigation-based application.  That\'s when you use buttons to navigate through different tables of data and settings.  The Setting app on your (or your friends\') iPhone is an example of a navigation-based app.  Maybe today you\'d like a tab-bar based app.  This is like the iPod app on the iPhone.  You have a menu of a few pages at the bottom of the screen that take you to different pages in the app.  Maybe you just want a blank window because you\'re building a game that your crew can play in the bus between gigs.  Anyway, after you decide that, it puts together the skeleton of your application with a bunch of different chunks of code that every single app is going to need to run.  The developer then fills out the skeleton and a newborn baby application is brought into the world.  Apple calls their development framework Cocoa, and for iPhone it\'s Cocoa Touch.  Cocoa is just a collection of pre-compiled libraries of code lashed together to help make the dev process that much easier.  Cocoa has a name, so it seems like it should be a physical thing.  It\'s not.  This has been one of the hardest parts about this process to get my head around.  It\'s a bunch of code that someone else already wrote so that you don\'t have to.\r\n\r\nRuby on Rails is also a framework.  A big part of writing Rails apps is using a command called \'script\'.  You call a script command to help you build these chunks of code, and the script automatically does a LOT of the tedious work for you.  I love this, because I don\'t have nearly the experience to write something from the ground up, and that sounds like a lot of wasted time besides.  Tweaking the generated code is then how the developer builds his app.  Brilliant.  This is what a development platform is.  This is why most Mac applications have that \"Mac-y\" look and feel.  This is why all these New-Web social networking sites have a that sorta clean, modern look and feel, and why so many of them employ Google maps as well as each other in their functionality.\r\n\r\nOnce you get your head around which platform you want to develop on (I\'m thinking Rails to learn), then you can start learning your way around the API, which is where the real fun begins.  I\'m not there yet, but will try to remember to link there when I am.','As in, what does that mean, anyway?  I\'ll try and keep it short.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke of Ruby on Rails the other day as the \'hotsh!t dev platform of the day\', I realized that it would need some clarification.  So let me clarify.\r\n\r\nCoding pretty much anything is a massive, time consuming job.  That\'s part of the reason that computer languages have evolved from 1s and 0s to Fortran to C to C++ to Java to Ruby: if you were to try and write the Twitter website in assembly language (binary), you\'d be there coding for a very long time.  If you were to try and write Windows 7, you couldn\'t do it.','','1277343710','2');

 And it was free!  So, here\'s how I picture RRE\'s overall web presence:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter\" title=\"RRE Web Presence\" src=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0919.JPG\" alt=\"RRE Web Presence\" width=\"472\" height=\"189\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So, great!  Now I can kind of get my head around it a little better.  I\'ve broken it into 2 main categories (for my purposes.  Media/PR is going to be handled by the proper authorities), our official presence and the one that is probably going to be even more important overall, the Community.  They both involve using the various social networks, and in the free version you can\'t link a child category to 2 parent categories, so I just created Social Networks for both.  Now, zooming in a little closer, you can start to organize which social networks on which you want to keep track of your presence:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter\" title=\"Social Networks\" src=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0918.JPG\" alt=\"RRE Web Presence\" width=\"350\" height=\"140\" /></p>\r\n\r\nand if you have a campaign specific to one of them, you can zoom in further.  BTW, the auto-spell checker on the iPhone automatically changes Twitter to Twitted (decidedly inconvenient these days), and there appears to be a bug in this app that won\'t let you dismiss the \"correct\" word.  Annoying, but I guess nothing is perfect.  Now I\'m going to turn my attention to the forthcoming fan site, which we will park at Railroadearth.net when all is said and done:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter\" title=\"RRE.net\" src=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0921.JPG\" alt=\"RRE.net&quot;\" width=\"420\" height=\"280\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">And the next Railroadearth.com:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter\" title=\"RRE.com\" src=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0923.JPG\" alt=\"RRE.com\" width=\"472\" height=\"250\" /></p>\r\n\r\nOr the RRE iPhone app:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter\" title=\"RRE.com\" src=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/IMG_0924.JPG\" alt=\"RRE iPhone\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">Holy crap!!!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">So, in closing, in two hours on the bus yesterday I was pretty much able to sketch out just about every component of our entire online infrastructure, which as much or as little abstraction as I needed.  God bless America!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \">Edit: So last night\'s deep thought was that I completely forgot to even mention how it works.  They call these diagrams \"Mind Maps\", and when you create a new one, you start off with that central blue bubble.  If you want to add a category under that you just click the button.  A different colored bubble shows up that you then name with the category.  You can move them around and add new ones and cut old ones out.  For instance, here\'s the revised overall scheme, to which I added the iPhone app and just tightened everything up:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left; \"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-310\" title=\"RRE Web Revised\" src=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/photo-300x184.jpg\" alt=\"RRE Web Revised\" width=\"320\" height=\"200\" /></p>','So, as I mentioned in <a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/blog/?p=33\">some other post</a>, after about my first hour or so playing with the iPhone, it came to me that this was a device that could help you get things done.  No more going to the computer, turning on the computer, waiting for it to boot up, etc., just to check my email?  A calendar that I always have in my pocket?  These were revelations to my unorganized old-self.  After the 2.0 update and the ability to add functionality to an already cool device was released, that\'s when the real fun began.','','1277343714','2');

Facebook is a place where people can make their own little website and stash pictures there to show their friends, etc., but the real innovation of Facebook has been to tap into the collective ADD of humanity and provide a place where you can tell people what you\'re doing and read about what they\'re doing, in small chunks.  Twitter is a place where you can tap into the collective ADD of humanity and tell people what you\'re doing and read about what they\'re doing in small chunks, but the real innovation of Twitter is their API.\r\n\r\nAn API (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\">Application Programming Interface</a>) is basically the software equivalent to a door into your application.  The 3rd party developer is then able to write his own application that uses that door to do stuff with the application (or it\'s data) on the other side.  It\'s cool.  It\'s what takes your application from being more or less a mute, single-celled organism to one that all the sudden can speak with others and communicate.  That\'s why there are so many Twitter clients coming out all the time.  Twitter on it\'s own is cool, if a bit mundane, but that they\'ve opened the system to others to make more fun/valuable for them is why they are changing the world right now.\r\n\r\nFacebook is paying close attention.  They\'ve kept lean and innovative where MySpace went bloated and corporate, but they\'ve always preferred the closed ecosystem approach.  All those applications that people continually send you are cool and all, but they force the developer to work within the confines of FB rules if you want to interact with the stuff that\'s going on within their walls.  And there is an unfathomable amount of stuff going on within their walls.

After the first bit my response became more like a blog post. So I\'m posting.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">----------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"drop_cap\">I</span> think the deal is that noone has come up with a solution that actually benefits the artist that the fans actually appreciate enough to pay for. Trent failed because everyone assumes he\'s already rich, so why bother. Plus he\'s trying to sell new music, which people just don\'t want to pay for anymore. Every record label is failing because nobody trusts record label executives and the stuff they\'re selling sucks anyway. It\'s scientifically designed to be disposable, so who\'s gonna pay for it? The only way forward is to start some kind of populist movement, but most semi-successful musicians just don\'t have the network or the wherewithal or the motivation or the ideas. I actually <a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/?p=147\">linked to that Trent interview</a> when it came out, because I do think he\'s way ahead of alot of other people that high up in the biz, but he\'s just trying to sell music with nothing else attached to it. Yeah, the iPhone app is cool, but it still feels kinda piecemeal to me, since he\'s basically working a brand that\'s already 20 years old and trying to adapt.\r\n\r\nWhere we\'re going to succeed is here : we aren\'t just selling music. We have a huge fanbase that is rabid about supporting us whenever they can and coming to as many shows as possible and spreading the word about us far and wide because we\'re where the party is. We\'re the ultimate grassroots marketing test for web 2.0. Even String Cheese (and their business model) came along before Facebook, etc. Our fans buy our T-shirts and our music because they were probably at the show and they want a piece of that, and if they weren\'t at the show, they want  it for the collection.  We draw more people to any given show in any given town than 9 out of 10 people you see on late night TV. But noone knows how to market us because we\'re older or we\'re not very good looking so therefore we don\'t fit into the nice little mold that is the only thing most people in the PR or record label end of the biz know. Therefore, the reason we do 1500 people in Denver (for instance) with virtually no press or airplay at all is word of mouth, because we\'re where the party is. After the first 3 pages of Tribes, I started to put some pieces together.\r\n\r\nHere\'s where I come in. I am not rich. I am not a label suit. I am not some manager trying to sell your band. I\'m not some software geek. I\'m just Grubb, the bass player from RRE that knows a lot people up and down and side to side in the jamband world. There is a huge amount of business going on here that hardly anyone pays any attention to unless it happens to be Bonnaroo weekend. As excited as the marketing world is about Twitter and Facebook, nobody over here really seems to get it. They do in a sense, but step number one, their websites - the first exposure to new fans for virtually all of us - look like shit, don\'t relay information, don\'t pull people in, don\'t look professional, don\'t give anyone a sense of who the band is or why they should be interested. I propose that if we, as a unit, started getting a lot more active about using the means available to us, and applying some dead-simple marketing initiative to our individual and collective web presence, we could start that populist movement this summer and put the last nails in the coffin of the <a href=\"http://www.wmg.com/\">crap-spewing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.riaa.com/\">download-suing</a> <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/\">dinosaur</a> that is the gasping, wheezing remnants of the major label/print media system.</span>\r\n\r\nThis is where the idea for the website/mobile app framework came from. It\'s not complicated or original. There are competitors already out there. See <a href=\"http://www.kyte.com/platform/pg/kyte_iphone_apps_framework\">kyte.com</a> for the iPhone app framework, but they don\'t get it either. Their product is kinda ugly to my eye, and they\'re apparently only concerned with selling it to labels for their puppets (Soulja Boy, All American Rejects) to have. A few bands have gone on their own and developed an app (Death Cab, PUSA, Trent), but what bands in this end of the biz have the resources to do that? None apparently, and it\'s a pity. It\'s a pity because our fans travel incessantly to see us and lots of them have iPhones now. The Model/Controller end of every app built upon such a framework could stay exactly the same, and the View could stay largely the same for each bands\' app. The possibilities are absolutely unlimited for the cool stuff you could put in there that would be of use to a traveling music fan...\r\n\r\nOf course, only a relatively small portion of the world has a smartphone at this time, but virtually everyone has internet access. A huge swath of our fans are first exposed to us and our music via our websites. Our (rre\'s) website is okay, but not too spectacular visually, not too easy to navigate, and the eCommerce part of it is so outdated and difficult to use that it might as well not be there. Somehow we still manage to sell stuff through our website, which is a testament to our fans\' determination to help support us. I suspect that many bands have a similar experience. They have merch there, but take a look at a well done eCommerce site, and there\'s no comparison. They need help. There\'s no reason to not have a better machine in place. One that\'s easy to use. One that\'s easy to find. One that integrates cleanly with the mobile app. I think I found the answer this weekend.\r\n\r\n','<p class=\"note\">Disclaimer(s) : I will me using the terms \"we\" and \"us\" and \"our\" to refer alternately to my band <a href=\"railroadearth.com\">Railroad Earth</a>, and to my colleagues in the jamband scene without differentiating every time which I\'m talking about.

Some backstory:\r\n\r\nThe Wakarusa festival has been going on for 5 years now (or something like that).  They experienced great success at the previous site of the festival in Lawrence, Kansas.  The only problem with the site was that it was held at a state park there, which gave local AND federal law enforcement free reign to be a real pain in the ass.  Lots of people got busted pretty much every year.  It was kind of a bad scene in amidst all the fun and great bands and good beer and 20k or so people that came.  We started doing it the second year, which must\'ve been the year that the promoters, both independent and corporate, decided to make a push toward making it a big festival.  We\'d never even heard of it before we booked it and all of a sudden String Cheese is on there and Wilco.  Cool.  Wilco was awesome - it was the Ghost is Born tour.  Anyway...\r\n\r\nDue to such monumental hassles from the law, they finally decided to find a new site.  They uprooted the festival and moved it to Arkansas - not their Kansas - to a giant farm out in the Ozarks.  The guy that owns the place is named Dewey.  He\'s an all around cool guy and he has a perfect place for holding a giant festival, complete with giant stage and all.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I noticed was the lack of beer.  Well, not exactly, but the keg beer was Miller High Life, which I can be all about sometimes, but usually not for an entire weekend.  That was really the only bummer of the entire festival.  The second thing I noticed was how much nicer the weather was than it ever was in Kansas.  It was usually brutally hot at the old site, but up in the Ozarks it was cool and clear all weekend.  Our set on Thursday night went very well despite some technical mishaps in front of Carbone.  I personally kinda like it when his gear malfunctions because he inevitably plays his ass off like he\'s trying to prove something, so no problem there.  The only thing was that for 15 agonizing minutes when we should\'ve been starting our set, there were a couple thousand people watching Tim have a hard time with his gear.  For those of you that were at DelFest, yes we need some stage help.  We know.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really noticed at this festival was the near-perfect timing of the stages.  Everything was timed to have traffic move from here to here to here like a ballet.  The walk from big stage to big stage was a lot shorter than the mile or so at the old festival site.  Camping was right there.\r\n\r\nOne other thing that I noticed was the huge preponderance of really young, wookie kids.  I think that just means that I\'m getting older because at one point I remember thinking that most of these kids were probably in middle school when Phish broke up the last time.  Young.  There were some young kids there, but it didn\'t have the family vibe like DelFest or High Sierra do.  Then I started pondering the sociological aspects of the festival scene in America and it\'s coincidence with Phish taking a break.  The rise of the big corporate-sponsored festival happened more or less when Phish split, which left legions of summertime revelers with no Phish show to follow.  Enter the big music festival and presto.  I\'m not sure about the economics of throwing a large festival like that, it\'s probably just dicey on a larger scale than a smaller family festival, but I think that corporate sponsorship probably helped to cushion the stress of making sure you brought enough people to the fest to pay the bands.  Couple a deep recession leading to corporate festival sponsorship drying up and people having less available income with f-ing Phish going back on the road and I\'d say it\'s probably going to be a rough summer for festival promoters.  Langerado already tanked.  Bonnaroo this weekend has Bruce Springsteen for a headliner (I can\'t fathom how the promoters of that one think that spending that much money on an artist like him is going to be worth it), so it should be interesting to see how that goes.\r\n\r\nConversely, it seems like a perfect time to be a club band.  It\'s not that much money to spend to go to a show, especially compared with a vacation or a festival.  Ahh, the music biz.\r\n\r\nMusical highlights :\r\n\r\nSly and Robbie.  The real deal.  Matisyahu went on after them, which must\'ve been rough for him.\r\n\r\nSplit Lip Rayfield, of course.  \"I drove that car for nearly two years, i even drove it on LSD...\"\r\n\r\nNew Mastersounds.  Yes, they are as good as everyone says.  Can\'t lose with british accents, either.','\'Twas an interesting time.

INSERT INTO `node_revisions` VALUES ('61','61','1','The phases of iPhone ownership, the beginning','For me, it began in December of 2007.  Anyone who reads this blog or has stumbled across it (as a surprising number have, unless there\'s a bot out there relentlessly searching for <a href=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/04/coolest-iphone-app-ever/\">my post on the Best App Ever</a>) knows that I\'m a fan.  I started off as a casual appreciator of the iPhone, and have since proceeded to jettison a lifetime of loyal MS-DOS/Windows computing in favor of being a blogging, Mac toting dork.  I\'m not ashamed.  My personal productivity has skyrocketed over the last 18 months, due almost exclusively to the tectonic shift in mindset brought about by my consumer relationship with the House of Jobs.  And now, for your enjoyment (I hope), I present the emotional cycle of iPhone ownership.\r\n\r\n<h3>Prehistory</h3>\r\n\r\nIt started off for me simply enough.  I\'d been a Cingular customer-cum AT&T customer since the dawn of cell phone use (for me).  I\'d been through a few phones over the years, most notably the old bricky Nokia that worked great and only did that <i>one thing</i>.  I was perfectly happy for a number of years, but eventually I was seduced.  I wanted something with a bit more style, more pizazz.  I\'d been reading the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-what-phones-are-apples-iphone-buyers-throwing-away-2009-7\">Motorola Razr</a> PR for a while, and thought that perhaps it\'d make me happier, what with it\'s flippy coolness and it\'s camera.  It even held the promise of being a music player, though a cursory glance could\'ve shown a lack of a headphone jack or any real internal storage.  I didn\'t care!!  I was leaving the droll stability of the good thing I\'d had with Nokia.  \r\n\r\nYou can tell where this is headed.  The camera sucked.  The phone dropped calls all the time.  The flip thing bothered me as much as I always knew it would.  It wouldn\'t even let you set your own ringtones from your own music that you already freaking owned.  It was extremely uncomfortable against your ear.  It would connect to the crap ringtone store spontaneously and download the new NeYo tune for me.  Repeatedly.  Finally after less than 6 months, the thing just died altogether.  Actually, I snapped it in half one night, so I guess you could say I terminated it, with extreme prejudice.  This was about two weeks before Noah was due, so obviously I needed a new phone pronto.  \r\n\r\nI\'d already seen Jimmy hanging out with it.  He sent me an email with the signature at the bottom reading Sent from my iPhone.  What a dork.  I was intrigued...\r\n\r\n<h2>Phase One - Infatuation</h2>\r\n\r\nIt was a rainy December day.  I had a notion that since I\'d just re-upped my Cingular contract months before, the new contract discount wouldn\'t be applying to me on this day.  The suspicion was confirmed by the (very cool and helpful) dude at the store.  A new Razr would cost me $379.\r\n\r\nOr I could just get an iPhone for $20 more.\r\n\r\nThe first week was a revelation.  The mere act of checking my email and being done with it in less time than it took my POSVRPC (Piece of $h!t, Vista-running PC) to even reach the first splash screen on booting up was like a dream come true.  I immediately regretted my purchase of the POSVRPC only two weeks earlier, as the iPhone could easily get me through the relatively gig-light winter.  I wrote a blog on the iPhone within days on MySpace - old-school - praising Apple as the \"Barry Bonds of product design - every swing, out of the park\".  This was before the steroid allegations really came to light, but the comparison is probably still apropos.\r\n\r\nI\'d never bought an iPod, so having music to listen to was another big one.  I\'m sorry if I\'ve written about all this before, but the real winner was when Noah was born and I had pictures emailed to the family within minutes.\r\n\r\nThe contacts and the calendar?  I\'d actually bought a Palm Pilot in college, deep in my freelance gigger days, but couldn\'t make myself carry it around all the time, which seriously negated it\'s effectiveness.  In short, I started to see that if I couldn\'t get my life together with an iPhone, I was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','For me, it began in December of 2007.

I was fascinated by the prospect of adding apps, though I didn\'t really know what I would want to add to the thing that wasn\'t already there.\r\n\r\nHad a nice loooong road trip down I-81 to contemplate such matters.

Everybody in the future is going to be carrying these things around, so if you\'re not with it, you\'re a friggin Dinosaur!  I wonder how you write these things?  It must not be that hard - the experience is so smooth, it must be really easy!  I need to do some research.\"\r\n\r\nSo I\'ll spare the details of what I found about programming iPhone apps, since that\'s basically the theme of this entire blog, but let\'s just say it\'s a <em>bit</em> more involved than I thought.\r\n\r\nMy involvement with Facebook only really began after the installation of their iPhone app.  Same with Twitter.  Or Wordpress.  Or jogging.  Or blogging.  And on and on.  So in a way, you could say that everything I\'ve gotten interested in, or re-interested in, over the last year and a half - programming, design, marketing, my band - has been because of that little doo-hicky.  Thanks Steve!  On the other hand, the recent dearth of LiveDownloads is also partially attributable to that thing, also, since engineering and production have kinda lost a bit of their luster as a serious career path for me.  Sorry, guys.  Net positive, though, to be sure.\r\n\r\n<h2>Phase Three - Seperation and reunion</h2>\r\n\r\nI lost my original iPhone.  I won\'t go into where, or when, or how, but it was a major bummer.  I\'d already bought a Mac by that point, since iPhone and Mac development doesn\'t happen on a Windows machine.  Oh well, twist my arm.  Besides, in the year that I\'d been an iPhoner, my life had slowly but surely realigned itself around being in touch and on top of things, so even if I hadn\'t decided on development as a future career path I was certainly not going back to the \"old way\".\r\n\r\nLuckily, at the Rockaway Mall Apple store, they gave me the AT&T subsidy, so that my 3G didn\'t cost me a million bucks.  Only half a million.  The 3G, of course, has GPS, which I didn\'t think was really going to be that big a deal.  I was already a good navigator and always had a map in my pocket.  I was wrong.  \r\n\r\nGPS went hand in hand with a cool app that I\'d gotten just after that called <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=291890420&mt=8\">iMapMyRun</a>, which tracks your runs, your training progress, and just happens to run on that little doo-hicky that you already had in your hand since you like to listen to tunes while you jog, which, by the way, neither did you jog nor did you listen to tunes a year prior to that.  Goodness.  So you could definitely say that loosing my original phone turned out to be a blessing in disguise.','<h2>Phase Two - Love</h2>\r\n\r\nThe day that I knew I\'d found the one was July 12, 2008.

It\'s functionally just like the normal website, which is to say a little spartan in terms of design.  The fantastico part of the app is it\'s integration with <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/\">InstaPaper</a>.  I discovered all of these services at the same time, since they basically feast off of each other (much like the tech press).  InstaPaper is totally made for somebody like me.  What it does is let you save stuff you want to read on the web, but don\'t necessarily have the time for right then.  You install a little bookmark in your browser which send the page to InstaPaper\'s server.  Their server then downloads the page (I think) and pulls it up for you when you go to the site later.\r\n\r\nThis is where it gets really good.  Say you\'re on the plane getting ready to pull back from the gate, about to lose cell service for however long.  InstaPaper also has a <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284942713&mt=8\">great iPhone app</a> that will pull the article off the server and cache it on your phone, meaning you don\'t need access to the web to read the article.  It even formats it for the iPhone by pulling the stuff from between the \"content\" div tags, which is presumably the article that you want to read, and does away with all the bells and whistles and CSS and ads and all that.  The end result isn\'t perfect, but it\'ll keep you busy on the plane for a while.\r\n\r\nSo the process for me last week was this : Reddit -> find interesting article -> click Save to InstaPaper.  Before I got on the plane -> open up InstaPaper and download everything I had marked for later.  Kept me busy for most of the flight.

Your entire crew gets them and you just <em>know</em> they\'re gonna be borrowing your charger.  Yes, I\'ve got my charger with me.  Jesus...\r\n<!--break-->\r\nYou\'ve since moved away from actually programming the thing, since object oriented programming is one giant blob of convoluted shit for a 30 year old bass player with a kid to try and pick up in his spare time.  Besides, web development really seems like more bang for the buck.  Might not pay as well, but this whole iPhone gold rush is pretty much over anyway.  You read all the tech blogs by this point - you\'ve turned your manager onto NetNewsWire before abandoning it yourself to try Google Reader but <a href=\"http://al3x.net/2009/07/18/fever-and-the-future-of-feed-readers.html\">you\'ll ditch that soon, too</a> - so you know how annoying it would be to try and get your app through <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/143265621\">the Apple process</a> were you even capable of coding such a thing.  You don\'t even check out the App Store that much anymore, since there\'s nothing but a bunch of stupid <em>games</em> over there anyway.\r\n\r\n<h2>Phase Five - Resentment</h2>\r\n\r\nThis began in earnest for me about three weeks ago.  In fairness, it\'s not completely the fault of the iPhone.  A good bit of the aggravation is due to AT&T\'s service.  It\'s just not that good.  It was really good (or so I thought) when I first got the thing, but I swear since however many millions of people have bought iPhones the network has gotten noticeably slower and spottier.  There was a voicemail outage this past weekend that affected nearly everyone on the network whether they knew it or not.  I was in St Cloud MN last night with \"full bars\" and 3G service, but couldn\'t get a page to load all night.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty inexcusable to me.  AT&T\'s one and only job - for which they are well paid - is to deliver the services that they promise.  At Rothbury and Wakarusa the service was unusable and the 10,000 or so iPhoners that were at Rothbury (not an exaggeration, they were the only phone I saw all weekend, at least half the phones there it seemed) were reduced to communicating via text.  Whaa, whaa you might say, and ordinarily I might agree with you, but you know what Verizon did at both of those festivals?  They brought in a mobile antenna to provide service to the festival site for their customers.  Does AT&T even have such a truck?  Could they be bothered to bring it to the festival site in the middle of nowhere where 10,000 of their customers were going to be savaging their shitty network all weekend?  Apparently, no, on both counts.  Inexcusable.  (The upside is that someone had the good sense to put together a <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=320578228&mt=8\">Rothbury App</a> which worked great for me all weekend.  The schedule was imbedded so I wasn\'t reliant on the no-cell coverage and I always knew what band I was watching at the time.  Very cool.)\r\n\r\nThe other thing that I\'ve noticed in the last weeks is that the new OS 3.0 is a good bit slower than the previous version.  Boot up time and app launch time, both slower.  This is ostensibly because there are new features loaded into the new OS, but many of those features aren\'t even available to 3G and OG iPhoners.  So all we get is copy and paste and a dog of a phone.  I\'ll be getting the new one, whatever version it is whenever I get it, but in the meantime I\'m left avariciously playing with Stacy\'s new 3GS.\r\n\r\n<h2>In closing</h2>\r\n\r\nThe iPhone is awesome, but if you don\'t have one - wait.  It will most likely be coming to Verizon sometime in the next year.  I will be jumping ship when it does.  My advice for the meantime - get an iPod touch and stick with your cell phone that works.  There will be a new phase for me after the resolution of this current dark period while AT&T gets their act together (I hope), or it goes over to Verizon, but in the meantime it\'s #attfail for me.','note: Parts <a href=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/07/the-phases-of-iphone-ownership-the-beginning/\"><strong>one</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/07/the-phases-of-iphone-ownership-continued/\"><strong>two</strong></a>.\r\n\r\n<h2>Phase Four - Complacence</h2>\r\n\r\nIt happens to the best of us.

See <a href=\"http://www.polarbearfarm.com/blog/?p=124\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://rc3.org/2009/08/01/apple-vs-my-preconceived-notions/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dashes.com/anil/2009/07/apple-secrecy-does-not-scale.html\">here</a> for some very well reasoned complaints and observations from developers on how the process could be much more successful.  \r\n\r\n\r\nChief among these complaints are the fact that the flipside of what makes Apple\'s products so successful (the closed and tight-lipped Apple ecosystem) is that they have tried to exert an amount of control over the AppStore that simply isn\'t feasible.  The very idea of trying to \"control\" the open 3rd party market is an exercise in futility - Prometheus can\'t un-steal the fire.  Make no mistake, Steve Jobs would never have allowed 3rd party developers to start developing applications for his device had people not already been <a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2007/08/08/iphone-hacking-101-jailbreaking/\">jailbreaking</a> these phones by the hundreds of thousands.  He\'s not the kind of guy who likes others cramping his style and having a market of people openly hacking the OS on their iPhone definitely qualifies as cramping his style.  He succeeded in stemming the tide and turning it to Apple\'s advantage for a time, but the dike has been leaky the whole time.  Remember the <a href=\"http://blogs.oreilly.com/iphone/2008/07/ing-nda.html\">NDA</a>?  That\'s the ham-handed non-disclosure agreement that Apple had in place on all their developers after the official release of the iPhone SDK (software developers kit) which expressly forbid anyone from even talking about iPhone development.  How are people supposed to make the most of your platform when you won\'t even allow a message forum for your developers to talk to each other and for newbies to learn?  They did away with that provision several months ago, but their treatment of the developer community hasn\'t improved much since.  The great irony in all of this is that the AppStore is absolutely jam-packed with total shit at the same time that well known and respected developers are having their hard work rejected for highly dubious reasons.\r\n\r\nWhen the day comes that someone gets the ecosystem right - meaning the proper combination of user, manufacturer, and developer base - the beginning of the golden age of software will truly have begun.  Since a little over a year ago I\'ve imagined where we are now in the evolution of the software biz as being sort of like the dawn of radio, in the vacuum tube/fireside chat era.  The invention of the transistor (and the portable radio soon after) ushered in the golden age of the music business, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dowd\">Tom Dowd</a>/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Ertegun\">Ahmet Ertegun</a> days, when starting a band to make a living and maybe even get rich must\'ve seemed like a reasonable proposition for a person with a modest amount of musical talent.  For a person or a band with a lot of talent and business acumen to support it it must\'ve been like the wild west.  That\'s the sense I get from the software sector right now.  That\'s why I\'m here.\r\n\r\nThe record business vein is pretty well played out by many measures, but that\'s the nature of evolution.

The examples he cites - Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, U2 - are all apparently seeing a downturn in their ticket sales for their most recent runs.

Maybe the live business has to give that paradigm up.  At least for a decade, until new acts are grown.\r\n\r\nWe want music that resonates.  And we want music.  Lady GaGa is outfits.

I do believe that P2P sharing played a part in killing the record business of yore, but no more than the CD-R, no more than the laptop computer, and certainly not as much as the overall disposable quality of pop music over the last 15 years.  People don\'t want to see those acts live.  And the Kings of Leon?  They\'re the future?  So, the future looks exactly like the past - young, pretty kids that sound and act like the Rolling Stones that have a sugar-coated and easily swallowed press story.  Kill yourself.\r\n\r\nThe reason that this depresses me is that the entire music business still views itself through the same lens that it has for the last 20 years - huge amounts of money to be made from relatively little effort, and if it doesn\'t pay off there are a hundred other candidates waiting to get in line for their shot.  Not a single thought is paid to building a business (act) in the time tested manner that every other business has to go through in order to turn a long-term profit.  The Police didn\'t do much on their first two albums, but 2 years after that they were the biggest act in the world.  Luckily their label didn\'t dump them, or who would headline Bonnaroo 25 years on?\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a side question - Who\'s gonna play the Super Bowl Half Time show in 10 years?  Death Cab for Cutie?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/08/02/the-concert-business/\">The link</a>','I read a piece the other day that really irritated the holy crap out of me.  An acquaintance had posted a link to <a href=\"http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/08/02/the-concert-business/\">this article</a> proclaiming the \"implosion of the concert business\".  The examples he cites - Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, U2 - are all apparently seeing a downturn in their ticket sales for their most recent runs.  This is not surprising to me and I assumed that it wouldn\'t be surprising to anyone, but according to Mr. Lefsetz it\'s a cause of concern for many a concert promoting Dinosaur.  \r\n\r\nThis is the section that really kills me :\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Maybe no one cares to the equivalent of a multiplatinum level anymore.  Maybe the live business has to give that paradigm up.  At least for a decade, until new acts are grown.\r\n\r\n','','1277343715','2');

That\'s obviously where I have a great deal more experience and relative expertise than software but it\'s just so old hat for me.  I\'ve turned to the software business as a mental escape from sitting in the van/bus and thinking about the music business.  I\'m tired of the music business.  I\'ve learned pretty much everything I care to know about the music business.  So why keep doing it?\r\n\r\nI was in a pretty lame mood yesterday.  Toronto is very cool - at least the hood we were in - but I get burnt out on the traveling and the being gone from Michelle and Noah approximately two hours after I walk out the door.  We\'ve been in a tour bus for the last year, and the memory of being in the van is still fresh in my mind.  The opening act last night was grilling me after the show about what it\'s like to ride in a bus.  \"It\'s fine, don\'t get me wrong, but you can get real tired of traveling around no matter what the vehicle.\"  I\'ll elaborate on professional bus travel in another post.\r\n\r\nWe played a great show last night, though.\r\n\r\nAfter the show I remember thinking (because I wrote it down) \"as tired as I am of traveling, that\'s as good as we\'re playing\".  Meaning - all the glamour, the novelty, and the fun of traveling America has completely and utterly worn off by this point.  The only thing that keeps me going is the music, and the music has been better than ever lately.  Two nights ago at Niagara Falls I played better than I ever have before, without effort, and this has been happening a lot lately.  I\'ve been more often reaching a deeply meditative state while we play, I call it the Coltrane Zone.  The music flows without thought to get in the way, and it\'s the most spiritual feeling I know.  That\'s why I keep doing this.  \r\n','<span class=\"drop_cap\">W</span>e played in Toronto last night.  It was our first Canadian gig and it went well.

It\'s a broader version of my \"<a href=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/category/iphone/\">Phases of iPhone Ownership</a>\".  Enjoy.\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\n<div><br><p>=>Reprinted with permission from <a href=\"http://calacanis.com/\">Jason Calacanis</a>, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.mahalo.com/\">Mahalo.com</a> and co-founder of the <a href=\"http://calacanis.com/www.techcrunch50.com\">TechCrunch50.com</a> conference taking place on September 14-15th in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n<br><p>About six years and $20,000 ago, I made the switch to Apple products after a 20-year love affair with Microsoft. That love affair started with the humble PCjr and ended with an IBM ThinkPad. From DOS to the first version of Windows (the run-time version that only loaded one program), and on to Windows 95 and XP, I dealt with the viruses, driver incompatibilities and other assorted quirks of Microsoft’s wildly open ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p>It sucked to have to buy anti-virus software and reinstall Windows every 12 months, so moving to Apple’s rock-solid and virus-free OS was, in a word, delightful.</p>\r\n<p>Sure, everything on the Mac platform costs twice as much, but considering the fact that my entire career centers around a desktop connected to the Internet, it really doesn’t matter if I spend $2 a day or $20 a day for my hardware. I replace everything at about a two-year pace (i.e. phone, MP3 player, desktop and laptop). So, at $10 a day, what some folks spend on Starbucks, I have a two year budget of $7,500 for my gear. In fact, the only things I don’t replace every two years are my 30″ and 24″ Dell Monitors, which I tend to keep for five years.</p>\r\n<p>Over the last 12-18 months, my love affair with Apple has waned. Steve Jobs’ peculiar, rigidly closed, and severe worldview have started to cramp my style. It’s not entirely Steve’s fault, as Apple’s style and grace are a large part of what drew me to the platform initially. My collection of Mac products now includes seven iPods ($1,500), four Mac laptops ($8,000), two Airports ($500), a Time Capsule ($500), two Mac towers ($4,000), a Mac Mini ($600), two iMacs ($4,000) and all three iPhones ($1,500).</p>\r\n<p>The cost of these items is just over $20,000, or about $3,300 a year. That’s almost exactly $10 a day–what I budget for technology in my life. Half of that is personal, half of that is probably business. While I know I am a high-end consumer, since I do this for a living, I think there are many folks putting $5-10 a day toward hardware. Blogger Robert Scoble of RackSpace must spend $20 a day and Leo Laporte of This Week in Tech must spend $40 a day!</p>\r\n<p>Key Point 1: For the past six years, if Steve makes something, I buy it. Sometimes, I buy two (one for my wife).</p>\r\n<p>Key Point 2: I over-pay for Apple products because I perceive them to be better (i.e. Windows-based hardware is 30-50% less–but at 38 years old I don’t care).</p>\r\n<p>The Love Affair Ends<br>\r\n===================<br>\r\nSteve’s a great guy, and the love affair has been wonderful, but I’m starting to look past him and back to Microsoft for a more healthy relationship that is less–wait for it–anti-competitive in nature.</p>\r\n<p>Years and years after Microsoft’s antitrust headlines, Apple is now the anti-competitive monster that Jobs rallied us against in the infamous 1984 commercial. Steve Jobs is the oppressive man on the jumbotron and the Olympian carrying the hammer is the open-source movement</p>\r\n<p>For folks in the tech industry, this is not a new discussion. Another radical visionary, Steve Gillmor, has been hosting this discussion since Apple’s draconian iTunes updates led smart people to *downgrade* their software. Think about that mind bomb for a second: people downgrading their software to maintain their freedoms–is this a William Gibson novel?</p>\r\n<p>Steve Jobs is on the cusp of devolving from the visionary radical we all love to a sad, old hypocrite and control freak–a sellout of epic proportions.*</p>\r\n<p>[ * Important Note: I\'ve written this piece three times over the past year and never released it. It felt like releasing something like this about a personal hero when they were, according to all counts, dying was too harsh. With Steve back to work and healthy for what will probably be his last five to ten years of full-time work (based on when most folks retire), I feel obligated to let this out. I know many folks in the industry are saddened to see our LSD-taking, radical free-thinking and fight the power hero, turning to the Dark Side. This note is written from a place of admiration and love.   ]</p>\r\n<p>The Case, The Five Parts<br>\r\n===================<br>\r\nI’d like to discuss four major issues around Apple’s current product line that I believe are stifling the industry, consumer choice and pricing. Instead of just giving a simple solution to the problem, I thought long and hard about the opportunities for Apple to be less controlling and more open. For example, if the iPhone was available on more carriers, Apple would sell many, many more units, which would inevitably lead to people switching from Windows desktops to Macs (which is what happened with the iPod).</p>\r\n<p>Bottom line: Of all the companies in the United States that could possibly be considered for anti-trust action, Apple is the lead candidate. The US Government, however, seems to be obsessed with Microsoft for legacy reasons and Google for privacy reasons.</p>\r\n<p>The truth is, Google has absolutely no lock-in, collusion or choice issues like Apple’s, and the Internet taught Microsoft long ago that open is better than closed.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s look at the case against, and the opportunities for, Apple:</p>\r\n<p>1. Destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices<br>\r\n——————————————————–<br>\r\nThere is no technical reason why the iTunes ecosystem shouldn’t allow the ability to sync with any MP3 player (in fact, iTunes did support other players once upon a time), save furthering Apple’s dominance with their own over-priced players. Quickly answer the following question: who are the number two and three MP3 players in the market? Exactly. Most folks can’t name one, let alone two, brands of MP3 players.</p>\r\n<p>On my trips to Japan, China and Korea over the past couple of years, I made it a point to visit the consumer electronics marketplaces like Akihabira. They are filled with not dozens, but hundreds, of MP3 players. They are cheap, feature-rich and open in nature. They have TV tuners, high-end audio recorders, radio tuners, dual-headphone jacks built-in and any number of innovations that the iPod does not. You simply will not see those here because of Apple’s inexcusable lack of openness.</p>\r\n<p>Not only does Apple not build in a simple API to attach devices to iTunes, they actually fight technically and legally block people from building tools to make iTunes more compatible.</p>\r\n<p>Think for a moment about what your reaction would be if Microsoft made the Zune the only MP3 player compatible with Windows. There would be 4chan riots, denial of service attacks and Digg’s front page would be plastered with pundit editorials claiming Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer were Borg.</p>\r\n<p>Why, then, does Steve Jobs get a pass?</p>\r\n<p>Steve Jobs gets a pass because we are all enabling him to be a jerk. We buy the products and we say nothing when our rights are stripped away. We’ve been seduced by Steve Jobs: he lifts another shiny object over his head with a new eco-friendly feature and we all melt like screaming schoolgirls at Shea Stadium in ‘65.</p>\r\n<p>Simple solution and opportunity: An iTunes API which allows the attachment of any mass storage device,not just a short list of players that jumped through Apple’s hoops. If need be, perhaps consumers pay a simple licensing fee of $1-5 a unit to attach a non-Apple MP3 player to iTunes (i.e. pure profit for Apple).</p>\r\n<p>2. Monopolistic practices in telecommunications<br>\r\n——————————————————–<br>\r\nApple’s iPhone is a revolutionary product that has devolved almost all of the progress made in cracking–wait for it–AT&T’s monoply in the ’70s and ’80s. We broke up the Bell Phone only to have it put back together by the iPhone. Telecommunications choice is gone for Apple users. If you buy an Apple and want to have a seemless experience with your iPhone, you must get in bed with AT&T, and as we like to say in the technology space, ‘AT&T is the suck.’</p>\r\n<p>Simple solution and opportunity: Not only let the iPhone work on any carrier, but put *two* SIM card slots on the iPhone and let users set which applications use which services. (Your phone could be Verizon and your browser Sprint!) Imagine having two SIM cards with 3G that were able to bond together to perform superfast uploads and downloads to YouTube.</p>\r\n<p>3. Draconian App Store policies that are, frankly, insulting<br>\r\n——————————————————–<br>\r\nLike lemmings, we fell for your bar charts extolling the openness of the iPhone App platform and its massive array of applications. We over-paid for your phone–which you render obsolete every 13 months, like clockwork–and then signed our lives away to AT&T. The way you pay us back is by becoming the thought police, deciding what applications we can consume on the device we over-paid for!</p>\r\n<p>Yes, every application on the phone has to approved by Apple, and if you were interested in something adult in nature…well…you can’t do that.</p>\r\n<p>Apple’s justification for this nonsense is that they have to protect AT&T’s network. Oh really? Aren’t there dozens and dozen of open phones on everyone’s network? The network hasn’t crashed yet, and even if someone did create a malicious iPhone application, you would know EXACTLY who was running the application and be able to block and/or turn off their phone. The network was MADE to deal with these issues on a NETWORK level. To say you have to control people down to the application level defies all logic. A second year CS student understands this.</p>\r\n<p>Who in their right mind feels the need to control the application-level anyway? It’s absurd.</p>\r\n<p>Imagine for a moment if every application on Windows Mobile or Windows XP had to be approved by Microsoft–how would you react? Exactly. Once again we’ve enabled Steve Jobs’ insane control freak tendencies. This relationship is beyond disfunctional–we are co-dependent.</p>\r\n<p>Simple solution: Apple could have a basic system setting that says ‘Allow Non-Approved Applications.’ When you click this setting, a popup could come on warning that, if you click this setting, you are waiving your previously-understood customer service arrangement (i.e. only people with approved applications can hand over their money at the Genius bar).</p>\r\n<p>4. Being a horrible hypocrite by banning other browsers on the iPhone<br>\r\n——————————————————–<br>\r\nOpera is a fantastic browser built by a company in Oslo, Norway. In fact, a decade ago, I had a speaking gig there and got to interview the CEO of the company for Silicon Alley Reporter. (Sidebar: Man, do I miss being a journalist. I wish I could split 50% of my time being a journalist and 50% of my time being a CEO.) For over a decade, Opera has been making lighting-fast, lightweight and quirky browsers. Long before Apple launched Safari, with the goal of designing the fastest browswer on the Web, Opera was already there.</p>\r\n<p>Opera’s mobile browsers are ‘full of WIN,’ as the kids like to say these days. If you’re a Windows Mobile or Blackberry user, you’ve probably downloaded them and enjoyed their WINness. The company started an iPhone browser project but gave up when faced with Apple’s absurd and unclear mandate to developers: Don’t create services which duplicate the functionality of Apple’s own software. In other words: ‘Don’t compete with us or we will not let you in the game.’</p>\r\n<p>The irony of this is not lost on anyone who had a computer before they had an Internet connection. Apple was more than willing to pile on after Microsoft’s disasterous inclusion of Internet Explorer with Windows. In fact, what Apple is doing is 100x worse than what Microsoft did. You see, Microsoft simply included their browser in Windows, still allowing other browsers to be installed. In Apple’s case, they are not only bundling their browser with the iPhone, but they are BLOCKING other browsers from being installed.</p>\r\n<p>Simple solution and opportunity: Don’t be a control freak and hypocrite. Allow people to pick their browser; the competition to make a better browser will increase the overall use of iPhones and mobile data services.</p>\r\n<p>5. Blocking the Google Voice Application on the iPhone<br>\r\n——————————————————–<br>\r\nApple took Google’s innovative and absurdly priced phone offering, Google Voice, out of the App Store and is currently being investigated by the FCC for this action. This point is similar to the browser issue, in that Apple wants to own almost every extension of the iPhone platform. How long before Apple decides to ban a Twitter client in favor of an Apple Twitter-like product? Seems crazy, I know, but by following Apple’s logic you should not be able to use Firefox or Google Chrome on your desktop.</p>\r\n<p>Simple solution and opportunity: Let people have three or four phone services coming in to their iPhones and perhaps charge a modest licensing fee for those types of service. Or, just simply stop being jerks and let the free market decide how to use the data services they’ve BOUGHT AND PAID FOR. That’s the joke of this: you’re paying for the data services that Apple is blocking. You pay for the bandwidth and Apple doesn’t let you use it because, you know, they know better than you how you should consume your data minutes.</p>\r\n<p>In Summary<br>\r\n——————————————————–<br>\r\nI’m not a huge fan of government involvement in business, so I would rather see Apple resolve these issues for themselves.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, I believe many forces are already at work, with Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and Peter Rojas of GDGT.com (and founder of Engadget) coming out publicly against these very issues. Neither of these two individuals will use an iPhone *specifically* because it is incompatible with their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Apple will face a user revolt in the coming years based upon Microsoft, Google and other yet-to-be-formed companies, undercutting their core markets with cheap, stable and open devices. Apple’s legendary comeback ability will be for naught if they don’t deeply examine their anti-competitive nature.</p>\r\n<p>Making great products does not absolve you from technology’s cardinal rule: Don’t be evil.</p>\r\n<p>It also doesn’t save you from Scarface’s cardinal rule: Never get high on your own supply.</p>\r\n<p>Questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. Do you think Apple would be more, or less, successful if they adopted a more open strategy (i.e. allowing other MP3 players in iTunes)?</p>\r\n<p>2. Do you think Apple should face serious antitrust action?</p>\r\n<p>3. Do you think Apple’s dexterity and competence forgive their bad behavior?</p>\r\n<p>all the best,</p>\r\n<p>Jason</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>(Via <a href=\"http://calacanis.com\">The Jason Calacanis Weblog</a>.)</p>','For those of you following along at home, here\'s <a href=\"http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/\">The Case Against Apple–in Five Parts</a>.

Whomever posted the comment about the tall trees crowding out the saplings has a very definite point, and one that speaks to the core of the problem with the music business.  In the 5 years since Phish \"retired\" an entire festival culture managed to spring up in it\'s place.  I don\'t personally believe that Wakarusa, Bonnaroo, Rothbury, or any of the rest of them would\'ve have been able to take root and become the ecosystem that they have without Phish\'s absence.  And for Phish to come back at the time that they did - with the economy already in the shitter and festivals thusly placed on shaky financial ground - seems a little bit rude to me, as a casual observer.  \r\n\r\nNow, why should Phish give a rats ass about Langerado?  They shouldn\'t, I suppose, because business is business.  If Phish has a superior product to whatever festival or band might otherwise get the attendance and people vote with their wallets to go to Phish, then more power to them.  Personally, I hope once this year is over and people have gotten their fix Phish either goes back to cashing checks from their investments or sees some decline in their numbers next year.  I don\'t care how good they are, how big they are, how hard they\'ve worked, or how long they\'ve been around, Phish is a Dinosaur exacerbating the issues that have essentially taken down the old way and are keeping a chosen few on life support.  They become a logo for the popular music press to feel like they\'ve given some face-time to the \"alternative\".  They become an easy distraction for music lovers out there that would otherwise be looking for a new band, a relevant band, to follow around.  I\'m not just talking about RRE.

Not too much in the mood to write about what I\'ve learned when most of what I\'ve learned is how much I have to learn, y\'know?  Anyway, I\'ve been back into Ruby on Rails lately, since Ruby has got to be the dead simplest real programming language out there.  Oh yeah, and I have a major project cooking on Rails, but I\'ll elaborate later.  Let\'s talk about version control...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\'s pretend you\'re typing that last term paper in college.  This is the modern era, so we\'re using a word processing program.  That program has eaten a few of our papers over the course of our college career, so we know to save our paper often.  This is a huge paper, so we\'ve also decided that it\'d be prudent to save it under different names as it progresses so that we can go back in time to an earlier version with no hassle, y\'know just in case we stray too far from the objective in the future.  This is basically the same idea behind version control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When dudes or dudettes are sitting at their text editors coding away at whatever they\'re coding, in whatever language, they\'re typing characters into a keyboard, just like I am now.  The difference with software is that there are usually numerous files that all relate to each other in some way, and a change in any one of those files will impact the entire application.   So say you make one little change here and another little change there, and then you skip over to another file and make a change there, and then you skip over to another file and make a couple of changes there.  How the hell are you supposed to keep track of all that?  Version control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever the flavor - <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/\">CVS</a>, <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\">Subversion</a>, <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> - all version control systems track changes made to the files in your fledging (or production) application.  The manner in which they do this varies from system to system, and they all have their proponents and detractors, but that you have GOT to be familiar with at least one of them is beyond dispute.  These will give you the ability to hack around all you want in the comfort of knowing that you can roll these changes back if you\'re not getting anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the only problem with all of these version control systems is that they don\'t track changes to databases.  The reason that this is a big deal is that the vast majority of large, modern, dynamic websites store a lot of data in their database.  Some content management systems like Drupal actually store templates that determine how the website gets rendered to your browser in their database by default.  You can change this if you know what you\'re doing, and that assumes a lot.  Nothing is going to change the fact that many database powered websites have to occasionally make changes to the layout (schema) of their database to incorporate new features and the like.  The new Like feature on that site probably has it\'s value stored in a column somewhere in a database.  What if that feature sucks or is buggy?  How can you roll back a database to an earlier state without using up your quota of blood pressure meds too soon?  Under traditional version control systems, you can\'t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, someone has figured this out for us.  It\'s called a \"migration\".  I\'ll be back.  I promise...</p>','<p>So it\'s been a while, eh?  Not too much in the mood to write about what I\'ve learned when most of what I\'ve learned is how much I have to learn, y\'know?

INSERT INTO `node_revisions` VALUES ('96','96','1','Chapter 6b - the layman\'s introduction to database migrations in Ruby on Rails','<p>This is not for programmers.  This is for myself, because when I first started poking at Rails 6 months ago, I didn\'t have any idea why I needed to edit a migration file, much less what a migration was, except that it must have something to do with a database.  I only knew that because of the command </p>\r\n<code>$>rake db:migrate</code>\r\n<p> that I was told to perform and the fact that it had the letters \"db\" in it.<p>\r\n<p>So here\'s the deal.  This morning I talked about <a href=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/10/chapter-6a-version-control/\">version control</a> and it\'s place in the life cycle of your application.  What version control does is keep track of the changes that you make to your applications source code from start to finish (whenever that is).  The only problem with this is that a big chunk of the data <em>and</em> functionality of a modern web application doesn\'t reside in the app\'s source code, it resides in the database, and nobody has invented an efficient version control system for a database yet.  Some friends of mine have tipped me off to different methods that they\'ve used - mostly around writing down DB schema changes into a text file that then gets placed under version control with the rest of the source.  That\'s not entirely efficient, though, is it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruby on Rails has come up with a system called \"migrations\".  Actually, someone surely came up with this way before Rails was invented, but I\'m new here, so feel free to correct me in the comments section down there.  Let\'s say you create a new rails app (This is directly from the awesome book \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Web-Development-Rails-Third/dp/1934356166/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1255546866&sr=8-1\">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>\" by a bunch of smart folks, and this example is the beginning of building a shopping cart system) :</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>$>rails newapp</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This generates a load of boilerplate code which makes up the bones of any Rails app.  That means that instead of spending the first week of the development cycle sitting there writing low-level code that provides primordial programmatic structure, you can spend it writing code that actually does something that you (or your client) can interact with.  Let\'s keep it as simple as possible and say that you are going to have three fields that will be stored in the database to start. Rails let\'s you run this scaffold generating command:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>$>ruby script/generate scaffold product title:string description:text image_url:string</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This command runs a ruby script that builds a LOT of code for you, so much that you\'re only minutes away from tinkering around and you only started a few minutes before that.    This command creates the \"products model\", which is how a programmer says that they are going to start by creating some place for the admin to store the products that they want to sell online.  The fields that were initially created were for the name of the product, the description, and the URL where you\'re storing the picture of the product.  Don\'t worry about it too much, but take a look at the command up there, it\'ll make sense if you know what a string is.  Just know that the data entered into these fields is going to get stored in a database.  Wait, how are we gonna store this stuff in our database?  Have we even created the tables for the database yet?  No.  Rails does it for us.  Here\'s how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the files that is created when we run that scaffold generator is called a \"migration file\".  This migration file is what actually creates the tables in the database, the columns in the tables, and can even populate the tables with data (used for testing), depending on what you do to the migration file.  There is a command (or method if you\'re OOP savvy) created when the scaffold is run called the \"up method\".  That\'s the one that changes your database.  There is also a \"down method\", which is what undoes the changes to your database.  When you run the good old <code>rake db:migrate</code> command Rails goes applies the appropriate changes to your database for you, and provides a way to undo them later.  So, your client comes in and wants to add a Price column to the store.  In the old days, you\'d execute this SQL statement :</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>ALTER TABLE products ADD column price DECIMAL (8,2) NOT NULL;</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what if you wanted to undo that?  That\'s a command you ran there, not some source code that you can save and delete later if you change a few things.  You can\'t place SQL statements under version control.  You\'d have to go and type that statement into the text file that was under version control, and then hope that you could effectively backtrack to it later if you wanted.  If your application and it\'s database have come a ways since that command you\'re going to have a good time figuring out how to undo it.  Rails doesn\'t make you do that.  In fact, you almost never are going to talk directly to your database in Rails.  Instead, you go to the most recent migration file (which <em>is</em> source code and thus under version control) and alter a line to look like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>add_column :products, :price, :decimal,\r\n:precision => 8, :scale => 2, :default => 0</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then you run a script that alters the database for you.  Below this add column instruction, or \"up method\", you add the remove column instruction, or \"down method\":</p>\r\n\r\n<p><code>remove_column :products, :price</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the undo button for your database and any schema changes along the way.  Since this command is under version control, and since you\'re not directly interacting with your database, and since Rails knows how and which migrations to apply and in what order if you ever want to go back to a previous version, you\'ve just made your life a LOT easier.  Now if you only understood what the hell you were talking about!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a vastly better explanation, <a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html\">try here</a>.  Good luck.</p>','<p>This is not for programmers.

You don\'t have to give them anything about your identity if you don\'t want, and you can create your own subdomain, just like Blogger.  What Tumblr has over Blogger is a much more refined design.  There are a bunch of templates to choose from, just like Blogger, but I find them to be a little more easy on the eyes, and thus easier to read and navigate - all important to the blogging experience, wouldn\'t you say?  If all you want to do is start letting some of your thoughts out of your head in blog form, give it a whirl.

They too have a number of different design templates to choose from (though not as many as Tumblr), so setting up a blog that feels like you isn\'t too much of a challenge.  The great thing about Wordpress, the framework on which this website also runs, is that you can build outward.  Say you want to have a contact page, and a calendar of events on another page, etc, you can do that pretty easily (and quickly) with Wordpress.

My only other freelance programming buddy out there uses Subversion, so of course I decided to go Git.  Git has a great  site that will store your code for you called <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> - they kinda go hand in hand.  It\'s a fun and relatively easy place to start getting familiar with the process of controlling your code.  I\'ve been working out of a Rails book and am pushing the practice project that I\'m working on up to GitHub.  The best thing about Git for me has been that it only took me about 2 days worth of hacking and poking around to get it running like it\'s supposed to be.  This is in stark contrast to the week or so I spent trying to get Subversion happening before basically giving up.  I understand the concepts behind Git\'s system of source control much better than I understand Subversion, as well.  And GitHub is a (for now) free place to upload my stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason this excites me so is that I\'ve embarked on a learning project.  I briefly exposed my intentions yesterday on this blog, so if you get this via RSS, you probably already have the idea.  For those of you browsing the web version, the idea is basically a simple photo sharing site for wayward musicians.  I got the idea from a great piece of dressing room graffiti in Cleveland at the Beachland Ballroom, and the domain just happened to be available although admittedly of questionable taste.  Perfect for musicians, I think.  So I\'ve decided to try and build this thing as a Rails project.  That should make it functional, but gritty and cheap looking, just like it should be.  Anyway.

What I wanted then was to get out of the kitchen and play professionally (with my college educated hands), to travel, and to learn about the music business.  Check, check, and check.

It took an iPhone to spark the idea that I should take matters into my own hands and start learning how to program myself.  So, for the last 18 months, that\'s what I\'ve been doing.

Then a record deal came along.  I\'m a lawyer\'s son, so when it became apparent that this deal was probably going to actually happen, it kinda screwed up my plan.  I couldn\'t sign a piece of paper committing myself to RRE and touring for the next 3 or 4 years when I knew good and well that I didn\'t have it in me.  That\'s when I knew I had to tell my bandmates what was going on with me.  Needless to say, they were probably a little surprised themselves.  I gave them until the end of next May, but they\'ve rightly decided that since a new record needs to be written, and we won\'t be on the road while that\'s happening, it\'s probably best to just go ahead and call it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'m not sure what the future holds, but I\'ve got a few ideas.  I know how much RRE means to many of you, and many of you probably think I\'ve gone off my rocker reading this, but I have to ask you to trust me.  RRE has meant a lot to me, too.  I\'m lucky to be able to say goodbye to a few of my favorite cities in America - Denver, San Francisco, and Portland - before hanging up my cables after the New Year.  RRE is an unbelievably good band, and I have no doubt that they\'ll pick a worthy successor for me.  At the very least they won\'t have to talk some kid into sleeping on hotel floors for weeks on end anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To my bandmates I want to extend my deepest thanks for the opportunity to do exactly what I always dreamed of doing for the last 7 years, and to play the best music I\'ll probably ever play.  To Mikey and J Ro and Phil and Stacy and Alex and especially Gayle I want to say thanks for working way harder than I ever did to make sure that RRE not only had people at the show but that they were lavished in the most inviting atmosphere possible, even at the Nick in Birmingham.  To Brian I want to say thanks for talking me into such a ridiculous situation in the first place and for everything that you\'ve done for RRE.  And lastly to all the strangers who have become fans who have become friends, I will miss the hell out of y\'all, but I won\'t be too hard to find either.  I have an entire industry to try and save now, for the benefit of musicians and music lovers alike, and I\'ll need all the help and support I can get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for the ride, and I\'ll leave you with a little Gillian Welch...</p>\r\n\r\n<embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://johnnygrubb.com/swf/audio_player.swf?audio_file=http://www.tumblr.com/audio_file/240597614/tumblr_ksyoc1eCsy1qzc86k&color=FFFFFF\" height=\"27\" width=\"207\" quality=\"best\"></embed>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"alert\">EDIT : I\'m going to be checking in here frequently over the next several weeks as this process unfolds.

I was barely a year out of college and was already tired of washing dishes and rolling burritos for a living, so I prayed for a gig.  I met John Skehan within a week, and the rest is history.  What I wanted then was to get out of the kitchen and play professionally (with my college educated hands), to travel, and to learn about the music business.  Check, check, and check.  I never intended to be a touring musician for the rest of my life, and have proceeded to plan my life with my wife and our son and our dogs accordingly.  We played Red Rocks a couple of months ago.

First, I want to let you know that I\'ve been making the internal preparations for this move for well over a year.  It was about that long ago that the force inside me that\'s guided me very reliably through my first 31 years here on earth began to lead me to this public announcement of my decision.  Second, I want you to know that I\'ve never ignored that force.  That force told me to print up business cards the week before I met John Skehan for the first time.  Third, I have no idea what I\'d do without that force.  I might have had some crappy job that I hated for the last seven years instead of touring the world with a fantastic band.  Fourth, trading this interesting, creative job down for some cubicle job programming VB is not what I have in mind (no offense to VB).  I have a very specific, interesting, creative idea that I\'ve been working on that I\'m gonna have a whack at, but it\'s a long shot.  I have some other interesting, creative options on the table, and I feel hopeful that one of them will pan out.  Fifth, and this is probably going to be the most difficult for some of you to believe, but the worst case scenario - unemployment, bankruptcy, foreclosure - still makes me feel more optimistic about the future than the prospect of ignoring that force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s all.

I tried to read it in college and failed miserably - it was just way too wordy and too deep for 20 year old me.  For some reason about a month and a half ago I picked it back up and gave it another try, shortly before I started coming to grips with the fact that my spell in RRE is drawing to a close.  It\'s basically the tale of a man and his son on a road trip.  The man has battled mental illness in the past, the memories which were erased by shock therapy.  The book is partly the tale of his putting his past back together again via a philosophical exploration while riding on a motorcycle (obviously) from Minnesota to San Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got a lot out of this book this time.  Whether it\'s the station I\'m at at this point in my life, whether it\'s the fact that I have Noah now, whether it\'s the fact that I\'m just older now, I didn\'t have much trouble with the sections that gave me trouble 11 years ago.  On the contrary, there were several sections that could\'ve been written about me.  There is one in particular where the narrator is recounting a portion of his past where he taught Rhetoric at the University of Montana in Missoula.  One semester he decides to conduct an experiment - to do away with grades for the whole semester.  The students will receive a grade at the end of the course, and not before.  The section that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up is toward the beginning of his recount of the experiment, when he\'s stating his hypothesis.  I\'ll quote it, rather than summarize.  Pardon the length.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><p>Phaedrus\'  argument for the abolition of the degree and grading system produced a nonplussed or negative reaction in all but a few students at first, since it seemed, on first judgment, to destroy the whole University system.  One student laid it wide open when she said with complete candor, \"Of course you can\'t eliminate the degree and grading system.  After all, that\'s what we\'re here for.\"</p>\r\n<p>She spoke the complete truth.  The idea that the majority of students attend a university for an education independent of the degree and grades is a little hypocrisy everyone is happier not to expose.  Occasionally some students do arrive for an education but rote and the mechanical nature of the institution soon converts them to a less idealistic attitude.</p>\r\n<p>The demonstrator was an argument that elimination of grades and degrees would destroy this hypocrisy.  Rather than deal with generalities it dealt with the specific career of an imaginary student who more or less typified what was found in the classroom, a student completely conditioned to work for a grade rather than the knowledge the grade was supposed to represent.</p>\r\n<p>Such a student, the demonstrator hypothesized, would go to his first class, get his assignment and probably do it out of habit.  He might go to his second and third as well.  But eventually the novelty of the course would wear off and, because his academic life was not his only life, the pressure of other obligations or desires would create circumstances in where he just would not be able to get an assignment in.</p>\r\n<p>Since there was no degree or grading system he would incur no penalty for this.  Subsequent lectures which presumed he\'d completed the assignment might be a little more difficult to understand, however, and this difficulty, in turn, might weaken his interest to a point where the next assignment, which he would find quite hard, would also be dropped.  Again no penalty.</p>\r\n<p>In time his weaker and weaker understanding of what the lectures were about would make it more and more difficult for him to pay attention in class.  Eventually he would see that he wasn\'t learning much; and facing the continual pressure of outside obligations, he would stop studying, feel guilty about this and stop attending class.  Again, no penalty would be attached.</p>\r\n<p>But what had happened?  The student, with no hard feelings on anybody\'s part, would have flunked himself out.  Good!  This is what should have happened.  He wasn\'t there for a real education in the first place and he had no real business there at all.  A large amount of money and effort had been saved and there would be no stigma of failure and ruin to haunt him the rest of his life.  No bridges had been burned.</p>\r\n<p>The student\'s biggest problem was a slave mentality which had been built into him by years of carrot-and-whip grading, a mule mentality which said, \"If you won\'t whip me, I won\'t work.\"  He didn\'t get whipped.  He didn\'t work.  And the cart of civilization, which he supposedly was being trained to pull, was just going to have to creak along a little slower without him.</p>\r\n<p>This is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of civilization, \"the system,\" is pulled by mules.  This is a common, vocational, \"location\" point of view, but it\'s not the Church attitude. [<em>not the church of the religious type, but I don\'t have time to explain all that here -jg</em>].</p>\r\n<p>The Church attitude is that civilization, or \"the system\" or \"society\" or whatever you want to call it, is best served not by mules but by free men.  The purpose of abolishing grades and degrees is not to punish mules or get rid of them but to provide an environment in which that mule can turn into a free man.</p>\r\n<p>The hypothetical student, still a mule, would drift around for a while.  He would get another kind of education quite as valuable as the one he\'d abandoned, in what used to be called the \"school of hard knocks.\"  Instead of wasting money and time as a high-status mule, he would now have to get a job as a low-status mule, maybe as a mechanic.  Actually his <em>real</em> status would go up.  He would be making a contribution for a change.  Maybe that\'s what he would do for the rest of his life.  Maybe he\'d found his level.  But don\'t count on it.</p>\r\n<p>In time - six months; five years, perhaps - a change could easily begin to take place.  He would become less and less satisfied with a kind of dumb, day-to-day shop-work.  His creative intelligence, stifled by too much theory and too many grades in college, would now become reawakened by the boredom of the shop.  Thousands of hours of frustrating mechanical problems would have made him more interested in machine design.  He would like to design machinery himself.  He\'d think he could do a better job.  He would try modifying a few engines, meet with success, look for more success, but feel blocked because he didn\'t have the theoretical information.  He would discover that when before he felt stupid because of his lack of interest in theoretical information, he\'d now find a brand of theoretical information which he\'d have a lot of respect for, namely, mechanical engineering.</p>\r\n<p>So he would come back to our degreeless and gradeless school, but with a difference.  He\'d no longer be a grade-motivated person.  He\'d be a knowledge motivated person.  He would need no external pushing to learn.  His push would come from inside.  He\'d be a free man.  He wouldn\'t need a lot of discipline to shape him up.  In fact, if the instructors assigned him were slacking on the job he would be likely to shape <em>them</em> up by asking rude questions.  He\'d be there to learn something, would be paying to learn something and they\'d better come up with it.</p>\r\n<p>Motivation of this sort, once it catches hold, is a ferocious force, and in the gradeless, degreeless institution where our student would find himself, he wouldn\'t stop with rote engineering information.  Physics and mathematics would come within his sphere of interest because he\'d see he needed them.  Metallurgy and electrical engineering would come up for attention.  And, in the process of intellectual maturing that these abstract studies gave him, he would be likely to branch out into other theoretical areas that weren\'t directly related to machines but had become part of a larger goal.  This larger goal wouldn\'t be the imitation of an education in Universities today, glossed over and concealed by grades and degrees that gave the appearance of something happening when, in fact, almost nothing is going on.  It would be the real thing.</p></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The hair on my neck is still standing up.  I did poorly in school.  Don\'t know why, but I just hated it.  I and my parents were routinely told by teachers what potential I had that was going to waste.  It was humiliating.  My overarching, impressionistic memory of my academic career is that of a humiliated mule.  As I mentioned in my <a href=\"http://ignoredByDinosaurs.com/2009/02/numero-uno/\">very first blog post</a>, I was kicked out of the band in 10th grade for not getting with the program.  And now I\'ve been a professional musician for the last 12 years, virtually since I left high school.  I don\'t blame anyone for my stubborn refusal to do the rote bullshit work we were all assigned, but something was clearly not right.  I was a kid, for crying out loud.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, the great thing about college was that it enabled me to shed a lot of the self-esteem issues that I graduated high-school with.  It also more fully introduced me to a very deep and powerful talent that had always been there, waiting to be discovered and nutured.  Music.  Music has made me what I am.  But at the same time, I can\'t help but feel that I\'ve been a mechanic for the last seven years.

It\'s been a long day.  We woke up without power this morning, which happens way too often in Stillwater.  No power means no heat and no water, since we\'re on a well and our pump is probably as old as I am.  So I got out of bed, lit a fire in the fireplace, lit the burner on the stove and got to making pancakes.  We were out most of the day, hence my tiredness.  Made an awesome black bean soup for dinner.  Not your typical black bean, but more of a Cuban influenced recipe that calls for a couple of tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.  It\'s awesome.  Maybe I\'ll start a recipes section on this site, which will be fully searchable as soon as I figure out Apache SOLR...\r\n\r\nSo anyway, today\'s tech discoveries.  First of all, Google Chrome for Mac was finally released yesterday.  It\'s not bad.  The thing with browsers now is that there is NO user loyalty, at least not with me.  Think back to the good old days when you didn\'t know there was a thing such as a browser.  IE <em>was</em> the internet.  I felt like I was cheating the day I went and downloaded Firefox, even though I was telling myself that I was merely subverting the paradigm or something like that.  I stuck with FF for a few years, for at least a month into my Mac-hood.  Then one day a weird thing happened (I don\'t remember what), and the advice I got was to try a different browser.  Opera was the one that was advised to make this broken site work, but Camino was the one that I was told was \"generally the best Mac browser\".  So within a month I\'d skipped out on MS completely, and had gone and stabbed my open source friends at Mozilla square in the back.  I mean, sure, Camino is a Mozilla product, but I\'m sure they knew where this was headed.  Safari 4.  JavaScript rendering so fast that it makes you actually say \"wow\".  And when your main email client is GMail, which is nothing but a mountain of JS (or AJAX if you wanna get particular), you start to notice such things.  That was only 6 months ago or so.  Now I\'m typing this post up in Chrome.  God knows where this ends.  I\'ll probably join some open source project one of these days.\r\n\r\nDiscovery #2.  JQuery Lightbox.  I can already tell that it\'s going to be derided as overused, but DAMN it\'s sweet.  Click on my \"Contact\" menu link up there.  That superfly effect that superimposes the form over the screen?  Seems kinda familiar, right?  That\'s JQuery in action.  Sweet.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, or sometime this weekend, I promise you a post on quitting a band, and the many ways in which it can go down as well as a state of my noggin report.\r\n\r\nthanks, all...','A few ruminations from my first day as a full time Drupal user.

INSERT INTO `node_revisions` VALUES ('113','113','1','On quitting a band.','I thought I\'d take this quiet opportunity to try and recall some of the thoughts that have been bouncing around my head the last few weeks.  I was thinking about all the various manners in which many of the bands that I\'ve known have experienced or dealt with personnel changes.  I believe there to be a spectrum, and my departure from RRE seems to fall somewhere in the middle.  \r\n\r\nOn the one side you have the \"okay, bye\" method, most notably employed by my friend <a href=\"http://www.hotbutteredrum.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2572&Itemid=174\">Zac Matthews</a>, formerly of Hot Buttered Rum.  (Funny, his was a November announcement as well.  What is it about impending winter that runs roughshod over summertime festival bands?  Rhetorical question.)  Obviously this approach has it\'s pros and cons.  The most obvious con is the sense of a lack of closure that the public can feel when one day everything is cool and the next their favorite band is no longer what it was.  I know I felt something of a shock when <a href=\"http://www.tealeafgreen.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=15721\">Ben quit Tea Leaf</a> or when John-O split SCI.  You want to know \"why?\"  Usually you are disappointed.  The pro (singular) of doing it like this would presumably be that relations within the band have deteriorated to such a degree by this point that dragging it out over a farewell tour would not be a good thing at all for anyone.  I\'m glad that\'s not the case here.\r\n\r\nThen there\'s the other end of the spectrum, most notably employed by <a href=\"http://www.jambase.com/Articles/9417/BILL-NERSHI-LEAVING-SCI\">Bill Nershi</a> of String Cheese Incident.  I\'m not going to rehash the reasons for his splitting, mostly because I\'m afraid he might be reading this.  Instead, I\'m going to guess at them.  Bill was the frontman of a huge operation.  They weren\'t just a band at the point when he had to call it, and hadn\'t been for many years.  As much as I look up to their operation, and the operation of Phish or even Umphrey\'s McGee as a band whose business model seems sound from my perspective, I can understand the pressure of finding yourself in that position of success.  Let\'s face it, most musicians don\'t become musicians because they like running companies, yet the more successful your band becomes the more of your time the business syphons off.  The less time you have to make music.  The less time you have to contemplate taking a break since the rest of the operation doesn\'t go on holiday just because you do.  I think this played a big part in Phish\'s hiatus, aside from the much publicized substance issues.  The business of being in a band can be a major grind.  I digress...\r\n\r\nThis approach also has it\'s pros and it\'s cons.  The most notable pro is that you can actually set it up in a very lucrative business-like manner for your last tour to be a \"farewell\" one.  I\'m not sure how much $ SCI made on that summer 07 tour, but they didn\'t play another gig until summer 09, so it must\'ve been okay.  The fans of the band get to relish a last hoorah, and the band members themselves get to say goodbye to a lifestyle as well as some of the locales that have become home out there, if only for a little while.  The cons of this approach are relatively minor, mostly having to do with people continually asking \"so what are you gonna be doing next?\"  It\'s a natural question, but you might not always have an answer ready.\r\n\r\nWhere I fall is somewhere in between.  I wouldn\'t quit this band if I were less than ready.  As I may have said to some of you, this decision took me years to come to, but on the other hand I\'ve known for years that it was coming.  Sometimes when I walk into a room full of hobos I get this feeling like everyone is looking at me, like I\'m a dead man walking.  And to be perfectly honest, I haven\'t had a ready made answer for what kind of music my band plays for the last seven years, so obviously I don\'t have a ready made answer to \"what are you doing next?\"  Well, I\'m gonna be programming.  You see this website?  I\'m gonna make a living off of it one day.  \r\n\r\nThe pros - I get to say goodbye.  \r\n\r\nThe cons - sometimes I\'m tired of saying goodbye.','Some personal and some purely speculative content ->\r\n','','1277343719','2');

It was the one where Edgar Meyer and Chris Thile were there, also.  They did the show after ours?  Anyway, I just wanted to tell you something...\r\n\r\nI spent the better part of my college years listening to a lot of MMW.  I actually had to willfully cut myself off because I was absorbing a bit too much of Chris\' style, in my youthful opinion.  I hadn\'t really listened to much in the several years since then, but it was still a bit of an intimidating treat to be on the set of this nationally syndicated radio show with Chris Wood and Edgar Meyer.  My bass teacher in college used to drag us to master classes down in Hickory NC, and Edgar\'s was one of them.  It was mindblowing, but I digress.  I went out and bought your album, <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Loaded-Wood-Brothers/dp/B00140GXSI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1260651688&sr=1-1\">Loaded</a></em>, the day after the taping.  \r\n\r\nThe point I\'m getting at is that we, as professional musicians, have been taught through many generations of unfortunate Pavlovian training to view the worth of our art through the lens of commerce.  How many units we sell is how good our record is.  Of course, we know that we\'re creating art and that the value of our work can\'t be quantified as simply and as greedily as that, but if your record doesn\'t move that many units, it\'s harder to stay excited about it as a work of art, isn\'t it?  It\'s certainly harder to keep our record label excited about it.  That fact is quite likely the fundamental cause of the mess that we find our \"industry\" in, wouldn\'t you say?  That it\'s an industry at all is part of the problem.  Irony.\r\n\r\nSo, I just wanted to take a moment to tell you, in public, what a profoundly great record it is.  It\'s moved me to tears more times than I can count, and almost every song on there has at one point or another perfectly summed it all up for me.  I haven\'t heard music as good since probably the first time I ever heard Gillian Welch.  I\'m not sure how many units it\'s sold, maybe \"not many\", but it\'s one of the finest albums I\'ve ever heard.

INSERT INTO `node_revisions` VALUES ('116','116','1','On record labels.','<!--break-->\r\nI was just thinking this morning about what a hilarious and glaring anachronism the term \"record label\" actually is.  The \"record\" as a popular medium for musical commerce was essentially replaced by the CD when I was about 5 years old.  There haven\'t been \"labels\" on popularly consumed music nor have they been sold in \"record\" form in approximately 25 years.  Yet mavins of popular culture wonder \"what will become of the record label system?\"  When will they finally embrace the digital model (or <em>a</em> digital model)?  Will they just continue to sue copyright infringers until it\'s no longer profitable to do so?  How long has it honestly been since record labels even bothered with the pretense of being purveyors of culture, anyway?\r\n\r\nA buddy of mine forwarded me a link to a <a href=\"http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2009/12/music-as-commerce-understanding-a-mindset.html\">nicely written piece</a> on the stages of music business decline that we\'ve all witnessed over the last ten years.  Recommended reading.\r\n\r\nSo, let\'s remove the rose colored glasses that I had on for the trip down memory lane that was <a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/recordingtechnology\">my post on the valuable service that record labels once provided to American culture</a>.  Let\'s talk about the flipside of the equation.  It\'s been a long time coming, and is something I\'ve been meaning to get to sooner.  There are many reasons I\'m leaving RRE at this time.  The fact that of the impending record contract which would obligate me for the next several years is only part of the story from my end.  One of the other parts is that I\'d feel kind of like a D-bag for signing a record label contract on the one hand while doing everything in my power to kick the legs out from under the entire faltering system on the other.  Make no mistake about it - I think that the record label system and most of the folks who have made a living in the record business for the last 50 years deserve everything that they are reaping right now.  They used to provide a service over which they had a monopoly - the recording and distribution of recorded works.  There was no practical way around the fact of recording and distribution for an artist in the age when physical media were the only media.\r\n\r\nThis monopoly was supported on all sides by a conglomeration of other media companies - print publications, radio stations, television studios - whose sole purpose was to make and promote product that made money for all.  The cultural side effects were a bonus as far as shareholders was concerned (if they were concerned at all).  However, all of these media outlets now find themselves in the exact same position of irrelevance.  The tremendous and spectacular downfall of the recording industry was only a prelude to what\'s to come for all the rest of these companies - witness the Boston Globe, or NBC, or any of the awful top 40 Clear Channel radio stations out there whose ad revenues are dwindling in the face of the coming storm.  Don\'t even get me started on TicketBastard and their \"convenience\" charge.  Go ahead and merge with LiveNation, you\'re only hastening and enlarging your own downfall.  It will come.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years there\'s been no practical justification for that model to remain in existence save for the folks in charge are familiar with it, that\'s how it\'s always been, and that\'s how it is.  They will all be dead soon enough, though.  Our musical and cultural heritage will not, however.  So it is up to us to figure out the path toward self-sufficiency in the cultural arts.  Here\'s my high-falutin\' theory ->\r\n\r\nIf what burned the old way to the ground was 1s and 0s, then what shall rise from the ashes and light the way forward for us all shall also be 1s and 0s.  This obviously means the internet.   Where other efforts to cram the old model into the new era have failed, ours shall succeed.  Where the old models existed for the enrichment of a very few in the business, the new model shall succeed in creating a sustainable livelihood for those of us who create art, who create cultural value, and who share our artistic wealth in the interest of enriching the lives of others as well as ourselves.  \r\n\r\nRecord labels and middlemen of all stripes be warned.  <em>I\'m coming for you</em>.','Can we get real for just a second?

I\'m a cliche!  All of these announcements were dated sometime in November - Billy in \'06, Ben in \'07, Zac in \'08, and myself in \'09.  I already asked, what is it about November that makes one of us flip out and quit our band each year?  Well, obviously, all of these bands are summertime festival circuit bands.  That was RRE\'s bread and butter, sort of like the hippy band equivalent of Black Friday.  Remaining closed on Black Friday is not an option for most retail businesses, just as not hitting the road each summer is not an option for a band that also wishes to remain a viable business.  So, how does that end up laying out your touring year?  We\'ll start in the spring...\r\n\r\nSpring tour is great.  People have been bottled up all winter and are ready to party.  You\'ve had all winter to get creative (or not) and hopefully have a boatload of new tunes ready for your crowd.  These are all club dates since festival season hasn\'t begun yet, and usually they are packed with a fired up crowd.  You deliver.  Your job is the best one on earth.  March, April, May.\r\n\r\nFestival Season!  It usually starts some time in April for most of us, though if you\'re lucky enough to be on the <a href=\"http://magmusic.com/\">Judy\'s fav list you might get to start early at SpringFest</a>.  The majority of your summer is spent doing what\'s called \"routing\", which means getting from good gig to good gig.  Hopefully, those good gigs are every weekend and Tuesday night is paying for the gas between Fridays, but if not, and your next gig is on an opposite coast, then you might be playing some of the dreaded \"routing dates\".  These are the gigs in Winters, CA on the Wednesday before High Sierra Music Festival, or the Bottleneck in Lawrence, KS before or after Wakarusa.  They\'re rough, not only because you get yanked from festival land back to club reality, but because the vast majority of the live band audience isn\'t really interested in going to the Bottleneck in the middle of summer.  Club owners don\'t have the option of shutting their club for the whole summer, and some scenes probably do a really good business in clubs in the summer, but ours ain\'t one of them.  File under : necessary evil.  It\'s cool, though.  On weekends you\'re a rockstar.  \r\n\r\nNow it\'s fall.  You\'ve already been on the road for half the year.  September might throw you a festival bone or two, but mostly it\'s back to the clubs.  The edge has come off of what were fresh tunes and a fired up crowd.  It\'s time to start laying out plans for the winter.  You need to write a new record, but you also need to keep the business going, so it\'s a constant push and pull.  Oh, you\'re on the road while you\'re deciding all of this so usually you\'re too tired to really be able to puzzle out the correct combination of dates that will keep the business far enough above water to enable you to do what you really want to do, and that\'s be home with your family and write some new music.  Your crowd will be there, and they will be expecting you to prove your otherworldly talent by delivering them fresh new tunes, preferably originals but whatever they want at the time will be fine.  Do not disappoint, my friends.\r\n\r\nSo you walk the line, and don\'t line up a winters full of shows so that you can get creative.  The problem?  You\'ve been on the road for so long by this point in the year that you don\'t remember how to write music.  Better line up some shows for February, since payroll is running out...\r\n\r\nWash, rinse, repeat for at least 7 years and what you have is a subconscious dread of winter.','I just realized this weekend that I missed something in Friday\'s post.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jambase.com/Articles/9417/BILL-NERSHI-LEAVING-SCI\">Nershi\'s announcement</a>.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.tealeafgreen.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=15721\">Ben\'s announcement</a>.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.hotbutteredrum.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2572&Itemid=174\">Zac Matthew\'s announcement</a>. </li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/11/and-i-bid-you-goodnight\">And mine</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSo, if you haven\'t already, take a look at the dates, and allow me to prepare a meditation on why November seems to be such a drag for touring bands...\r\n','','1277343719','2');

Belligerence is high.\r\n\r\nThe \"threat level\" was already at orange, and probably has been for several months.  It was not raised after the attempted attack.  This got me to thinking.\r\n\r\nHas the Bush/Cheney threat level mechanism actually desensitized us to the possibility of a terrorist threat so thoroughly by this point that even when there is an attack nobody really cares?  And if the ultimate goal of the terrorist is to make us afraid, and we\'re not really that afraid, have we now won the war on terror?  None of the security measures in place stopped this asshole, a fellow passenger did.  I\'m surprised they didn\'t beat him to a pulp, for if someone were attempting to blow me up on a plane on Christmas day, that\'s quite likely what I\'d be inclined to do.  And how much further past the point of diminishing returns are we going to push this quest for airline security?  Wouldn\'t we be safer giving all passengers a set of brass knuckles before they board the plane?\r\n\r\n','<blockquote>\"A systemic failure has occurred, and I consider that totally unacceptable,\" an angry and unusually blunt Obama told reporters near his vacation retreat in Hawaii.</blockquote>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-terror-obama30-2009dec30,0,887782,full.story\">via LA Times</a></em>\r\n\r\nA few points =>\r\n\r\nI haven\'t noticed any change in any security whatsoever in any of the 3 airports in which I\'ve been in the last three days.

He just sent me an email asking about downloading Wordpress.  I responded by asking why because downloading and using Wordpress isn\'t the piece of cake that you might think it is if you\'ve never dealt with web servers and databases before.  So I decided to make this public so that he and I and we may refer to it from now on.  Besides, this hasn\'t been blogged about nearly enough...\r\n\r\nWhen I first downloaded Ruby on Rails I was a bit perplexed.  It came with a README that gave these installation instructions that made no sense to me at all.  I didn\'t know anything about webservers at the time, or for a few months afterward, so here\'s what I learned.  This applies to Wordpress as well.\r\n\r\nWordpress and Ruby on Rails are both (more or less) database-backed content management systems.  (If you know anything about Rails, you go right ahead and light my comments section up.)  Drupal is, too.  This means that the post that you\'re reading right now isn\'t stored as a word document or a text file on a file system as you know it on your computer.  It\'s stored as plain text in a database.  Search the term here for a brief newby explanation from my ongoing programmer journal/book.  What this means is that you have to hook wordpress up to a database server to have your content served.  You also need to hook it up to a webserver to have your content served to and from a browser.  This sounds complicated because it kind of is until you do it once or twice.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Mac user go Google MAMP, and download it.  the AMP part of MAMP stand for Apache -the webserver, MySQL - the database, and PHP - the coding language that Wordpress is written in.  Pardon my grammar.  Install it.  Now you have a webserver and a database server on your computer, so you can play with Wordpress now.  In the MAMP directory somewhere is a folder called htDocs, which is the root of your webserver.  \r\n\r\nIf you make a subdirectory under htdocs called Wordpress, unzip and copy all the files from a Wordpress download, and start MAMP, you can then point your browser to http://localhost:8888/Wordpress and install wordpress in a way that you can then use.  You also need to create a database.  Use the PHPMyAdmin feature of MAMP for this.  Just figure it out.  You won\'t break anything.  Create a database and give WordPress the name of that database.  you\'re good to go with Wordpress on your \"local machine\".\r\n\r\nComments/Questions are down there.\r\n\r\nMore to come.','This post is for my buddy Jimmy.

Episode 2.','<p>So, you\'ve gone and installed MAMP and WordPress on your computer, or if you wanna sound really hip you call it your \"local machine\".  You\'ve gone and started building out a wordpress site for your school because your current website is an outdated embarrassment.  Wordpress is kind of the no brainer choice, or so your buddy told you, because it\'s super easy for anyone to use who\'s familiar with a word processor.  You\'d like to attempt to keep the content on your site fresh, so it sounds good to you.  Then you have a meeting with your principle and your so-called webmaster to talk about getting some of the things you\'ve done put up and made available to the world.  Then they drop a little piece of info on you.</p>\n\n<p>Your school\'s webhost doesn\'t do PHP, and they don\'t know if the district will let you move to another host.  Let me tell you what this seemingly innocuous piece of information means.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s means you\'re screwed.</p>\n\n<p>PHP is a programming language.  It\'s what\'s formally known as a scripted language.  <a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/chapter1b/\">I have a post here</a> that explains what that means.  Wordpress is written in PHP.  The advantages of a scripted language are what lead them to be used to write the majority of cool, interactive websites in the world.  If you wanna sound hip you call them \"web apps\", since that\'s what they are.  Site kind of implies a place, a static location that will be there when you come back and won\'t have changed much.  An application is something you interact with.  It does things for you, like letting you write news for the frontpage of your school\'s website that it will then display to the world without your having to go in and code HTML.  Applications run on computers, or servers if they are web applications.</p>\n\n<p>Compiled applications (the other kind besides scripted) have already been digested into machine code, which is to say 1s and 0s, prior to being run.  This means that they are essentially frozen and you can\'t alter anything about the source code without going through a rigamarole.  Scripted languages, in contrast, can be altered on the fly to add new features or fix bugs without having to be recompiled into machine code.  This makes scripted languages perfect for constantly evolving web apps.  The source code is right there on your webserver, and you can go and make changes to it.  The downside is that you have to have some special programmatic gear installed on your server.</p>\n\n<p>Scripted languages have to have their respective libraries of code installed in order to for them to be \"interpreted\" at \"runtime\".  This whole long explanation is to tell you that since your webhost doesn\'t appear to have the appropriate libraries installed, your WordPress application is going to look like a bunch of gibberish to your webserver.  You can upload it, but as soon as you point a browser at the index.php file, the server is going to throw a \"what the fuck is this?\", also called an error.  That\'s why you had to install MAMP on your computer in the first place, remember?  And unfortunately, installing PHP isn\'t an easy process, especially for someone who almost certainly doesn\'t have the proper \"permissions\" allotted to them in the operating system of the webserver.</p>\n\n<p>I realize there\'s a bunch of gobbledeegook in here.  I\'ll try to un-muddy the waters a bit in subsequent posts.  Specific questions are most welcome.  I should clarify that any webhosting company in the world is going to have PHP, and most likely a raft of other languages installed so that they can accommodate all types of clients and their disparately coded applications.  That your school\'s webhost doesn\'t have PHP - the most widely used web programming language in the world for the last decade or so running - tells me that your district has their own hilariously outdated webservers set up in the furnace room of some office somewhere.  We may be dead in the water, Jimmy...</p>','<p>So, you\'ve gone and installed MAMP and WordPress on your computer, or if you wanna sound really hip you call it your \"local machine\".

I was leaving of my own free will and for reasons that were plenty good enough for me.  What was this all about?</p>\n\n<p>By the time I got to Portland I couldn\'t take it anymore.  I\'d had enough of people being so nice to me.  I didn\'t deserve it.  People gave me cards with hundreds of signatures on them telling me that I\'d be missed.  Someone organized a can drive in my name at our Thanksgiving show, for Pete\'s sake.  What did I do?  I just played the bass!  I\'d have been doing it anyway, hopefully, and instead I got to make friends and play shows and get good at the bass and be a rockstar for years.  I didn\'t deserve this outpouring.</p>\n\n<p>So, to anyone reading this who was around in that period, this one\'s for you.</p>\n\n<p>I know I\'ll see some of you again, but I\'ll never see all of you again.  My life has been a blessing, a dream.  When I can transcend my neurosis and the chaos of my life currently for a few brief moments and really just take a breath, I feel so profoundly grateful for being a part of it.  You and I made it together, and it was so. much. FUN!  I kind of get it now, some of what there was to be sad about.  Change is usually a wonderful thing, a necessary thing, but in a sense I feel like I\'ve quit my family.  Like I\'ve spit in the face of the thing that we built.  For that I\'m both sorry and thankful for having had the experience in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I guess that\'ll do for now.  Hopefully this gets the writer\'s clog out.  I love you guys.</p>\n','<p>Well, it has been quite some time, hasn\'t it?  So much has changed!  So much is still the same!  Where to begin?

Being conscientious about organization and maintenance of the files in your computer you probably deleted the Akamai download manager after you used it.  You went on your merry way and are probably enjoying your Adobe product.  At some point you realized this really annoying hang that your computer has been doing.  You went to the Console app and saw a list of error messages a mile long about a call to some plist feature that OS X couldn\'t find.  You have glimpsed the trail of your enemy.

There was actually some useful info buried in there.  Here\'s the fix.</p>\n\n<p>First, you have to go back to Adobe and pick out any trial product to use (again).  This will cause the Akamai thing to be reinstalled on your system, which is all you\'re after.  It\'ll download that goofy Akamai thing again to a disk image which you then install.  It will then start downloading the Adobe whatever.  You can stop the download at that point.  Now open up the Terminal and paste this command -</p>\n\n<code>/Applications/Akamai/admintool uninstall -force</code>\n\n<p>This is the only proper way to uninstall that stupid thing that you didn\'t want on your computer in the first place and for which they don\'t even provide an uninstaller, just a little hint in a README buried in the Akamai folder.

It can actually mean a variety of different things, but most simply it means free software that anyone can use as is or alter as they see fit for their particular needs.  According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\">Wikipedia</a> - \"Some consider open source a philosophy, others consider it a pragmatic methodology.\"  I think I fall into both camps, but being the pragmatic, methodological guy that I am I shall present that angle today.</p>\n\n<p>When I first got into software and development a few years ago it was because of one of the most proprietary devices out there - the iPhone.  Proprietary is the exact opposite of open source.  It is not free.  You are not welcome to see the iPhone OS source code.  You are not welcome to use anything except for Apple\'s set of development tools to build iPhone applications.  You may only distribute those applications through the AppStore, of which Apple is the sole overseer.  I didn\'t consciously realize the implications of this stuff two years ago.  I just wanted to build a band app that all my friends could use and get rich.  So I bought a Mac and dove in.</p>\n\n<p>Upon diving in, I realized many things.  One is that Apple and their set of development tools - called Xcode (X as is OS X, the Mac OS) - came with the most amazing set of documentation on virtually every aspect of developing software built right in.  My education began there.  Poring over the included documentation and learning how the iPhone OS and Object Oriented programming worked on a high level was the beginning of the path for me here.  Among other things I learned that the Mac OS (operating system) and by extention the iPhone OS were built upon an open source OS called Unix.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix\">Unix has been around since the late 60s</a>, and was initially developed at Bell Labs.  Unix runs on the \"command line\", which is like way back in the floppy disk era when you used to have to type into DOS to get your computer to run programs.  Most professional developers I met at the DrupalCon a month ago seem to have a deep fear of the command line.  Luckily my early experience with Rails and Git got me over that fear before I learned that I should have one.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, there are many different versions of Unix out there, some open source (meaning open to anyone helping develop it) and some proprietary (meaning you have to pay a licensing fee to even use it).  Some hippies at UC Berkeley one day got tired of Ma Bell and her ridiculous licensing fees and decided to make their own variant called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_bsd\">Free BSD</a>.  To make a long story shorter, Steve Jobs and co. took Free BSD in the late 90s and made it the base of their new OS.  OS X, a really awesome, intuitive, stable operating system that only legally runs on Macintosh computers took an open source project as it\'s guts.  What the world knows as OS X is basically a really nicely designed wrapper over top of Free BSD.  If you\'re on a Mac and you go up to the Spotlight in the top right and type in \"Terminal\", you\'ll get the command line for your computer.  This is the real operating system you are speaking to underneath the glitsy OS X veneer.</p>\n\n<p>So what\'s the point?  Who cares?  Steve Jobs ripped off a bunch of hippies and now he\'s a genius?  Well, yes, and here\'s why.</p>\n\n</p>Windows, the beloved, world dominating piece of shit OS that never works right whether you know it or admit it or not is not an open source project.  It and it\'s source code have been sequestered away in Redmond WA for the last 25 years or so.  The only people allowed to work on it are MS employees following MS corporate policies, coding practices, and managerial and marketing direction in their development of Windows.  I liken this to being in a really high paid <a href=\"http://marctopaz.com/main.html\">Connecticut wedding band</a>.</p>  \n\n<p>By contrast, Free BSD - though a newer OS than Windows even - comes from a pedigree of having been developed and refined for the last 40 years.  Open source means anyone with the mind to can contribute to the project with only their own needs and imaginations as their guide.  Ultimately what happens in a sucessful open source project is that a <em>community</em> of developers begins to coalesce.  Different perspectives, features, and methodologies are brought in from all over the world by developers trying to solve problems, not by the marketing department downstairs or your manager who has to make his boss happy with this one feature.  What would be a security hole to exploit is plainly visible for all to see and for all to immediately get on top of fixing for the good of everyone who uses that software.  If you need a feature that doesn\'t exist yet, you write it yourself and share with everyone in the community.  I liken this to participating in the <a href=\"http://www.slopgrass.com/photo.htm\">late night jam at Slopryland</a>.</p>\n\n<p>That\'s probably enough for now.</p>\n\n','<p>What is open source?

Sometime in 2003 I joined a band with a neglected website.  At one of my first band meetings we discussed overhauling said website, since the majority of our fanbase was a grassroots kinda thing and most of our promotion happened via online channels like the <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=collection:RailroadEarth\">Archive</a> and <a href=\"http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/earthboard/\">YahooGroups</a>, etc.  Sometime in 2005 we still had that same website.  I was at my parent\'s house in north Georgia when it occurred to me \"hey, you know, you could probably learn how to build websites in the time that it\'s going to take this band to get it together enough to hire someone to do it.\"  If I\'d only listened to that voice more clearly, but instead I got bogged down on the Dreamweaver section of the Adobe site and gave up without really exploring what web development was all about.  I was still trying to be a musician in any case.</p>\n\n<p>Fastforward to 2008 and we\'d finally done something about our website a few months prior.  I got an iPhone.  I\'ll skip this part of the story since <a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/category/iphone/\">it\'s been documented ad nauseum on this blog</a>.  Anyway, it didn\'t take long for the potential of mobile apps as a huge and brand-spanking-new market to become an obsession.  In particular - the potential for such apps to help revitalize a music business that had become very long on the latter and very short on the former.  There\'s also the simple fact that in 50 years people are going to be on these little things and not big old screens anymore and therefore the internet is at the very least going to need to be reformatted.  So, start learning to program iPhone apps...</p>\n\n<p>Hey, this is hard to do yourself and really expensive if you hire someone.  Wouldn\'t it be cool if you could make a reusable framework for all your friends\' bands so that y\'all could share the cost and the rewards of such a system?  Well, if you\'re all sharing a mobile platform, you might as well be sharing a website platform too, since most of the stuff that\'s gonna be on that mobile app is going to have to live somewhere on the internet.  It\'d be a lot easier to just interact with one protocol than a million, right?  If I\'m not making sense, let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Well, hey if we got everyone on the same platform for their website, then we could also build in lots of features that would make those sites more interactive with the rest of the internet as a whole.  I mean, who likes posting your tour dates to your own website and then to Facebook and then to MySpace (or <a href=\"http://www.artistdata.com/us/\">paying someone to do that for you</a>)?

Instead of \"album cycles\" you\'d have \"rapid development\".  The product wouldn\'t just be music and the usual merch, but would really take advantage of technology to give the fan something more to interact with.  You\'d have a rocking website of course, which would be the main avenue through which new creative product would be distributed.  You\'d have a mobile app to give your fans commuting into NYC on the train something to play with/listen to on the way in.  The press would be so enamored with your savvy that you\'d barely even need a publicist.</p>\n\n<p>I think ideally you\'d have a couple of developers who play in the band, a really strong songwriter, and a producer type.

I built exactly the thing they asked me to in both <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a> and <a href=\"http://drupal.org/\">Drupal</a>.  I built the Ruby version first with lots of help from a friend in about 5 days.  I spent 3 agonizing days trying to launch it on a shared webserver before giving up and rebuilding the entire thing in Drupal with 36 hours left until the deadline.  The Drupal version lit up the first time I flipped on the switch and <span class=\"highlight\">saved my bacon.</span>  I had already bought a ticket to DrupalCon - happening in San Francisco a few weeks after that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Drupal (droo\'-pul)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While at DrupalCon I drank lots and lots and <em>lots</em> of open source Kool-Aid.  The buzz that I got at DrupalCon was exactly like the buzz I used to get at music festivals we\'d play every summer.  Tons of cool people hanging out, sharing ideas, drinking beer, meeting new cool people, and being excited about the same thing - the same cool, creative thing.  I went to sessions for geeks, for marketing folks, for freelancers, for non-profits, for you name it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I came back a Drupal developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the cool tools that I was introduced to there was called <a href=\"http://openatrium.com/\">OpenAtrium</a>.  It\'s basically a tool for managing projects, a thing that becomes very necessary the instant you get off the road and start building websites.  I had tried out <a href=\"http://basecamphq.com/\">BaseCamp</a> with my new gig and liked it a lot.  OA was essentially an open source variation, built on top of Drupal.  Many of the contributions of the Drupal developer community were rolled into one comprehensive, focused package that was probably done in a fraction of the time that an enterprise team would taken to do a proprietary version of something similar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open source is a very powerful idea.  Drupal is free.  All the cool things that people have built to customize and extend Drupal are free.  That\'s why Open Atrium is free.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The open source website system for musical artists</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So a cool feature of Drupal that\'s only recently getting attention paid to it is the \"installation profile\".  That\'s how OA works, and it basically means that you can set up Drupal how you want it (you can quite literally do almost anything that involves the internet with Drupal) and build a script that installs it that way anywhere.  You can have, for example, a <em>real</em> band website, for free, right out of the box.  The <a href=\"http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/blog\">blog</a>, the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/calendar\">tour dates</a>, the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/fbconnect\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/flickr\">Flickr</a> integration, the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/advanced_forum\">forum</a>, the <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/ubercart\">eCommerce</a> - virtually all of the pieces are <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/Modules\">laying right there</a>, waiting to be assembled by those of us who know how.  Those of us who need something that doesn\'t exist yet write it and give it back to everyone else using the system.  It\'s constantly improved.  The roadmap for this thing could be ridiculously cool.  The <a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/Services\">API possibilities</a> if a bunch of people started using this thing?  Come on!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know, the irony of this being a Wordpress powered site has occurred to me, but before I go and uproot and move this blog to Drupal so that we can get to collaborating for real, does this sound like a good idea?  One that could maybe change the game?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pssst, Drupal devs...</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t know if you\'ve noticed, but the guys who made up OA and PressFlow and OpenPublish are making a damn decent business as consultants for their product.  I don\'t know if there\'s any money to be made here or not, but this market has been waiting for this idea.  Hell, <a href=\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/1041\">Drupal has been waiting for this idea</a>.  I know a <em>lot</em> of people in the music biz that would probably be delighted to help us out.  We can get press and we can get traction.  Anybody wanna help out?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Edit: <a href=\"http://acquia.com/blog/business-models-drupal-distributions\">the post that put the last piece of this idea into place</a>.  Thanks, Dries!</p>','<h2>The open source website system for musical artists</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s so <em>obvious</em> when I say it out loud.

There\'s a few non-bassists who have given me more ideas than many of the bassists I\'ve grown up with.  So here goes.\r\n\r\n##\\#5 Cliff Burton\r\n\r\nI know, it\'s pretty fashionable to say Cliff instead of Jason, especially in light of the fact that it was Jason who actually inspired me to start playing the bass in the first place.  After years and years of begging my folks to let me be Lars and buy me a drum set, and years and years of begging the band director to let me be Lars and play percussion instead of trombone, I finally gave up.  I guess I figured the bass line on \"The God That Failed\" was pretty cool too, and strangely my folks were immediately agreeable to a bass in the house.  So I sat in the basement and played along with every early 90\'s grunge and metal record that I had.\r\n\r\nHowever, it wasn\'t until a lot later that I realized the depth of the influence that I had absorbed many years before I even began playing.  \"...And Justice For All\" was the first tape I ever bought and the first CD I ever bought a few years after that.  It was literally almost all I listened to for a four year period between 5th and 8th grade.  I didn\'t know anything about music or it\'s place in my future life, but in hindsight I learned everything I ever needed to know about harmony from that record.  Most of it was written either by Cliff when he was alive or in his memory shortly after his death and his highly educated, dramatic, baroque influence is all over it.  \"To Live is To Die\", \"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\", and \"Eye of the Beholder\" are all masterpieces.  When the black album came out and there was neither a double bass drum nor a multi-movement epic to be found on it anywhere, somewhere in my 8th grade brain I was deeply let down.  It wasn\'t Cliff\'s bass style that sunk in so much as the style of composition.\r\n\r\nIt\'s so nice to write.

It\'s an obviously lucrative market, which is why it gets the attention of so many innovators.  Well and good, but what about people who \"produce content\", we\'ll call them writers and publishers from now on...</p>\n\n<p>I finally experimented today with a service that I signed up for several months ago but never spent the 45 minutes to learn how to get it going.  It\'s called <a href=\"http://typekit.com/\">Typekit</a>.  The idea is <em>so</em> simple and <em>so</em> brilliant.  Allow me...</p>\n\n<code>&lt;geek content &lt;!--feel free to skip ahead--&gt; &gt;</code>\n\n<p>There\'s a fundamental issue when you\'re building a website that most people probably aren\'t aware of at all.  The issue is the limited number of fonts that you can reliably use to set the type on said website.  The vast majority of the world is browsing your site on a Windows computer with a standard set of fonts installed on it. Yes, fonts are installed on your computer.  It\'s a weird concept.  When you browse to a website, that website tells your browser what font it would prefer to have used when the browser shows you that webpage.  It\'s not at all uncommon for the designer to want to use a font that\'s not installed on that computer.  There are only about a dozen or so \"<a href=\"http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html\">web-safe fonts</a>\" that you can rely on, and it gets old really fast using those same fonts over and over and over.  If the designer wants to work outside that box a little he may ask the browser to call a more exotic font, but he\'ll also specify what he wants used if that font doesn\'t exist on the user\'s computer.  Confused yet?  An example perhaps...</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-family:arial\">This is a sentence set in Arial.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family:\'lucida grande\'\">This is a sentence set in Lucida Grande</p>\n<p style=\"font-family:georgia\">This is a sentence set in Georgia</p>\n<p style=\"font-family:\'courier new\'\">This is a sentence set in Courier New</p>\n\n<p>That\'s all cool, but what if you want to use something more exotic to give the name of the site <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">a bit more branded flair</a>?  Well, in the case of Twitter and most every other website on Earth that means firing up Photoshop and making it there.  You get many more fonts to choose from and you can always make your own if you want.  Photoshop then spits out your cool text as an image.  Yes, that Twitter logo is an image, not HTML text.  That means that every browser renders it just like you want it, but it also means that it\'s a relative pain to change and that search engines can\'t tell what it says unless you fill in a bunch of info about it.  HTML is preferable for anything that\'s meant to be read, but then you only get those dozen fonts.  Double rainbow of a bummer.</p>\n\n<p>So Typekit has a service that lets you use a whole bunch of different fonts, served up to every browser that\'s reasonably modern.  I won\'t bore you with the details (that\'s for another post), but it\'s a serious lifesaver.  I\'m working on a site right now and <span style=\"font-family:\'myriad pro\'\">my favorite Myriad Pro</span> just ain\'t doin\' it for the site header when it\'s set 3 inches tall.  For a variety of reasons I didn\'t want to go to Photoshop, so I dove in and tried out Typekit.  I soon came upon a cool font called</p> <h2 class=\"tk-cody bigger\">Cody something or other</h2>\n\n<p>Not exactly what the designer used, but vastly more stylish than Myriad.</p>\n\n<code>&lt;/geek content&gt;</code>\n\n<p>Now, here\'s why this is cool for all of us.  Services like this are actually starting to focus on the \"production\" end of the content business.  That\'s a very good thing for all of us.  That means that the web is finally hitting puberty as a publishing medium.  <a href=\"http://takeoutphoto.blogspot.com/2008/09/psychology-of-typeface.html\">There\'s a reason that there are a million different fonts in the world</a>, because an all Courier world would be very boring indeed.  It\'s a terrible thing that most websites only get a choice of a dozen different fonts, but it\'s a wonderful thing that someone is putting their head toward solving this problem for us all.  I personally think that this is a BIG market waiting to happen.  Get in now.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of BIG markets waiting to happen, has anyone tried out <a href=\"https://www.greplin.com/\">Greplin</a> yet?</p>','<p>And I\'m not talking about the iPad.

In the most basic sense all computer programs are scripts, be they <a href=\"http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/chapter1b\">compiled scripts or interpreted scripts</a>.  You must tell the computer what to do in no uncertain terms at all times for all possible scenarios.  Failure to do so is a Bad Thing.

He\'s building a site in Wordpress, so I thought I\'d post a few relevant pieces of info up here for him, and those of his ilk.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, realize that Posts and Pages are almost the exact same thing.  The key difference between the two as far as I can tell is not that Pages are easier to add to the top-level navigation, but that Posts allow you to classify them with \"Categories\".  This allows Wordpress to work it\'s relational database magic, and in the hands of a skilled template author you can really take a very simple system and make it produce just about any listing of content that you want.  When in the early stages of developing a site, it\'s better to take what you\'d think of as top-level content items and see if there\'s any way that you can make it a listing of Posts in a certain Category, rather than just dumping related info on one Page.  The chief advantages of working this way are maintenance and search-ability.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/\">Wordpress Codex</a> is a wonderfully organized place to learn a lot about authoring templates.  Most of the Wordpress core is basically just a large group of functions for talking to a database, and much of the magic of pulling the info back out in the way that you want it is in the template layer.  Thus, the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation\">Theme Development</a> section of the Codex is the place to spend a couple of days getting used to the way Wordpress works.</p>\n\n<p>I\'d suggest downloading my very <a href=\"http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme\">bare bones base theme</a> and stepping through some of the template files while browsing the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags\">Template Tags function reference</a>.

I need to order them in track order, it seems to always put the newest post first.  Ordering by permalink would work since I put the track number as the 1st part of the name.\n\n3) Gotta turn off the right nav stuff - not needed.\n\nI tried creating a category called Lyrics and then adding sub-categories for each album.  That created the Lyrics page with all songs listed, I wanted just links to the sub-categories; plus it made the menu real ugly with all the albums listed below main menu.  I resolved this by making Lyrics a page and putting links to the \'album\' categories in the html.  It seems to work fine but I am not sure if I could have done this another way.\n\nalso:  where do I comment out the \'add comments\' stuff?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alright, in order --</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Settings -> Reading and set the top option to display a static page as the home page.

I\'m not exactly sure how you want them to display in every situation, but I\'ll take a beginning guess.\n<ol>\n<li>The easiest, and in this case probably best way to go is to just make sure you enter the lyrics for the songs in the reverse order than how you want them to appear.  If you\'ve already entered some of them in, you can alter the \"published date\" on the edit screen of each lyric page.  I\'d just edit that have them line up in the order that you want.</li>\n<li>The more stylish option would be to write a function in your theme\'s <code>functions.php</code> file.  To make this work correctly you\'d have to make use of the \"custom fields\" feature.  I\'m a tiny bit rusty on the exact way to go about this, but basically \"custom fields\" are extra bits of metadata that you can add to any page or post in WP.  For instance, you could create one custom field with a key called \"track number\" and use the value of that field to define the track number.  You\'d then figure out the correct function to call with the correct arguments to make it show up in the right order when someone came to the lyrics section of the site.</li>\n<li>Doing the same thing from the theme template would also be an option, and probably a little more realistic since you\'d be able to have the correct template called by following the naming convention for a given category.  <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy\">This page</a> will tell you how.</li>\n<li>Slightly off-topic, but there\'s also the option of creating a blanket \"Lyrics\" category, and then creating a post for each album that simply lists the songs in the running order, and then links the song titles to another post that contains the lyrics for that song.  This option might give you the most control for the least effort.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>So you don\'t need a right sidebar at all?</li>\n<li>Right, yeah I would ditch the sub-categories for the albums, and probably go with option 4 above.</li>\n<li>If you look at <a href=\"http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme/blob/master//page.php\">line 29 on the page.php</a> file and <a href=\"http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme/blob/master//single.php\">line 39 on the single.php</a> file, you\'ll see the comment function.

He already owns the domain name.\r\n\r\nMy question is, once I build the site using MAMP, and get everything upload to our host, how does the domain name get transferred? Is that something we have to handle or the host handles.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJimmy</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Calling me a fool is his way of showing affection.  So, the answer is that \"it depends\".  If your buddy went the \"get your domain free with a year\'s webhosting\" route that many larger webhosts encourage you to do, then you don\'t have to do anything.  If your buddy bought the domain on the open market through a registrar such as GoDaddy, you have to dive into the scary, subterranean world of DNS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System.  A perhaps less-than-100%-accurate description --</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you buy a domain name, it\'s sort of like buying a spot in the world\'s internet phone book.  That is to say that the address <a href=\"http://johnnygrubb.com/\">http://johnnygrubb.com</a> is actually an \"abstraction\" of the information that a computer needs to complete your browser\'s request to get my webpage to come up.  What my computer needs to know is the IP address of the server where http://johnnygrubb.com lives.  The Domain Name System does that for you.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>If you need to look up the phone number of Newtown Chinese Restaurant in Newton, you go to the phone book, look for Newtown Chinese Restaurant and move your eye to the right to get the phone number.  If you want to go to any website, you enter the address in your browser, which takes the request and hits the nearest DNS server to find the actual IP address of the webhost so the requested page can be grabbed.  It\'s the job of the owner of the domain name to make sure that the \"phone number\" or IP address is correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you\'ve bought your domain name as part of a package, then you don\'t need to do anything.  The webhost actually owns the domain name and is letting you use it.  This has pros and cons obviously, the pros being that they handle all of this DNS stuff for you.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>If you\'ve bought the domain name separately, you need to give that name a \"phone number\" so that DNS knows who to call when you request a page from that site.  That\'s done by getting deep into your Domain Control Panel (or something like depending on the registrar) and and finding the \"Nameserver\" controls.  This is where you give your domain name an address.  It\'s usually in an english readable form, for instance, one of the nameservers for my hosting account is <code>ns1.mediatemple.com</code>.  That means that when a request is made for a page on this site, DNS says \"don\'t look at me, go talk to Media Temple\'s nameservers.  They know where to find that page.\"  Once the request gets to Media Temple, their nameservers say \"the page you seek is at 64.207.129.18\", which is the IP address of the actual server on which this site is plopped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to extend the analogy a little further, a DNS lookup is actually more like that movie where the kids are trying to find the super-cool party, only to get to the party they have to drive all over town from one destination to the next before they are finally given the actual address.  For real fun, type this is your Terminal --</p>\r\n\r\n<code>traceroute http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com</code>\r\n\r\n<p>This command will show you all of the different \"nodes\" out there on the web that your request hits before it actually arrives at it\'s destination, my webhost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the tl;dr is that if he bought the domain name through a webhost as part of a hosting package, you don\'t need to do anything.  If he bought the domain name on it\'s own, you need to go to the Domain Control Panel or the Domain Manager or whatever it\'s called where it was registered.  In there somewhere is a setting for the nameservers.  On the webhost\'s end, you\'ll find what their nameservers are (usually something like ns1.awesomewebhost.com and ns2.awesomewebhost.com) and put that information into the proper fields on the registrar end.  There\'s always at least 2 nameservers at every host because like all servers, they can go down and if they both go down your site will be unavailable.  It happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changing nameserver information is like firing an MX missile.  There is no \"undo\".  There is no recalling the missile.  Once you push the button to change the nameservers, that change of address starts filtering out to the rest of the world\'s DNS servers so that the request can be sent to the proper IP address.  This filtering-out process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending.  Once it\'s done, the whole world will be pointed to the party on your server.</p>','<p>Welcome back to another installment of the newby web developer series.

I consider myself pretty lucky to have been as successful as I was at \"the whole music thing\".  The problem, as you may have heard, is that it\'s really, really hard to make a living in the music business, <em>especially</em> as a performer.  It wasn\'t until I was quitting RRE that I read <a href=\"http://www.dannybarnes.com/blog/how-make-living-playing-music\">this Danny Barnes post</a> and figured out that right off the bat why I wasn\'t cut out for the music business.  I\'m just too materialistic -- I want to own a house, feed my kids the best food I can, maybe take them on a vacation someday, and actually raise them instead of being on the road 340 days a year to accomplish the other points from a monetary standpoint.\r\n\r\nSo, I took up programming after having an epiphany.  \r\n\r\nThis blog has thus far chronicled the journey from professional upright bassist to professional web developer.  I had intended to build something grand and glorious here for the benefit of my fellow musicians.  The idea was like fruit in a tree that I couldn\'t reach for lack of resources - neither the programming skill nor the money to hire programming skill.  As I\'ve been working furiously on my own programming skills, that fruit has kinda withered for me.  So, what I\'ve decided to do now is to sit, wait, sharpen my axe, and wait for the next idea to come along.

He\'s a teacher, and a fairly progressive, observant one at that.  I believe him when he says that there\'s nothing out there like this kinda simple, cool idea that he had.  I think it must exist somewhere but it\'s not being properly promoted if it does.  So, I thought maybe it\'d be a cool idea to try and teach him a little something about web development, and teach myself a lot in the process.  There\'s no way that this idea of his is currently within my grasp since a big part of the concept is an iOS app, but I don\'t think the overall idea is really that far outside the realm of possibility.  It\'s going to need a web backend to it, anyway.  So let\'s see.  Where to start?</p>\n\n<p>I think we\'ll build it in Rails since I\'ve learned enough about programming to know that I prefer Ruby as a language to PHP.  I think this idea could easily be done in Drupal (a large, flexible content management system that\'s built in PHP) as well, but for some reason the aesthetic of building the solution you need and no more is really appealing to me.  Drupal takes care of a LOT of the stuff that we\'re going to need to do upfront, things like user authentication (accounts) and interacting with a variety of different protocols - essential if the app phase is ever going to work.  Drupal and Rails are both just pieces of software that run databases for you, but the difference is sorta like the difference between buying a really good loaf of bread and baking a really good loaf of bread.  It doesn\'t make you any less of a chef to serve the store bought loaf to your guests, but if you have the time and you know how to bake a good loaf (or if it\'s just something you want to get good at), you\'re going to prefer that route.</p>\n\n<p>Step one is getting Rails installed on your computer which, if you bought a Mac is made significantly easier.  We\'ll do that next.</p>','<p>Does anybody here want to build something?  My buddy Jimmy of This Blog fame laid an idea on me the other night.  He\'s a teacher, and a fairly progressive, observant one at that.  I believe him when he says that there\'s nothing out there like this kinda simple, cool idea that he had.  I think it must exist somewhere but it\'s not being properly promoted if it does.  So, I thought maybe it\'d be a cool idea to try and teach him a little something about web development, and teach myself a lot in the process.','','1289939725','0');

If you look through the [archives](http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/archive/), you\'ll notice a relative dearth of posts from this time period.  Drupal just has a way of sucking all the fun out of blogging.  It\'s very, very slow for one thing.  I had a lot of trouble integrating the site with the Disqus comment system that handled all of my Wordpress comments before I made the move so I was forced to use Drupal\'s comment system.  I\'d written a couple of posts in the \"didn\'t find much in Google about it, so I decided to become the authoritative voice on it\" vein, and had a ton of comments on one of them.  Those comments appear to be gone now, even though I devoted an entire day to exporting them out of Drupal into Disqus with a [solution that someone came up with](http://drupal.org/node/269010 \"Migrate from Drupal comment.module to Disqus comments | drupal.org\").\r\n\r\nBasically, Drupal is a beast.  If you have a project that you are trying to build that involves users with accounts, and different levels of access to the content based on those roles, go with Drupal.  For anything else, anything simpler, stay away.  Drupal gives the impression of being somehow more user friendly since you can configure these massively complex sites without actually coding much of anything, but is that really a good thing??  Drupal\'s inherent dependence on [stashing so much configuration in the database](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2009/jul/09/development-staging-production-workflow-problem-drupal \"The Development -&gt; Staging -&gt; Production Workflow Problem in Drupal | Development Seed\") will be the death of the project if it\'s not figured out, and I personally don\'t think anything short of a MAJOR rewrite is going to sort it out.  The major Drupal rewrite that\'s about to drop on the world some time has taken 2 years to get even close to the door, and a rewrite that would effectively fix this particular issue would also effectively rewrite the entire philosophy of being able to build a site in the browser, arguably the whole reason for Drupal existence in the first place.\r\n\r\nI haven\'t even gotten to the part about moving Drupal to Git.  Why not put the whole thing up in GitHub?  Have you heard of Rails?  It\'s doing pretty well, and I\'d wager that a large part of the reason for that is how easy it is to dive in and contribute to open source on GitHub.  I\'ve never once seen it even mentioned to move Drupal to GitHub.\r\n\r\nanyway...\r\n\r\n##Reasons for migrating to Jekyll, regular ramble\r\n\r\nFirst off, it really wasn\'t that hard, so skip ahead if you wish.  I spent a good several hours on Github researching other sites that people had going on the platform out there.  I\'ve been studying a whole lot of Ruby lately, so it was down to Jekyll or a few other simple solutions.  I started building a solution out of Sinatra, but decided that deployment was probably going to be more of a headache than I felt like dealing with.\r\n\r\nI loved the idea of a static HTML site since one of my main gripes about Drupal was how many times I could count the little page load indicator going around on Chrome.  This site is blazing fast now, so yay for that.\r\n\r\nI love the idea that there are no security updates, no databases to backup, no crufty markup that comes from where exactly?  Basically, there\'s very little tradeoff.  It\'s mostly win.  So, on to the show.\r\n\r\n##Migrating from Drupal to Jekyll, the meat\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I didn\'t understand about Jekyll was that it doesn\'t really generate a site template for you (you get used to that when dealing with Ruby).  You have to build that part or Jekyll won\'t do anything at all.  It\'s easy enough to get started though, just Google or [borrow from other GitHubbers](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites).  The tricky part was liberating my posts from Drupal, which was made vastly easier by [this fellow having written a Drupal migrator](https://github.com/mattdipasquale/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/migrators/drupal.rb) only a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\nI followed all of the instructions on [this page](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Blog-Migrations) for getting the migrators to work, but kept getting an error message that ruby couldn\'t find the specified file or something like that.  So an hour or two of fiddling around with the migrator file in my Jekyll directory and finally changing the command to something like this -\r\n\r\n`ruby -r \'~/PLAY/jekyll/_import/drupal\' -e \'Jekyll::Drupal.process( \"#{ENV[\"DB\"]}\", \"#{ENV[\"USER\"]}\", \"#{ENV[\"PASS\"]}\")\'`\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere `~/PLAY/jekyll` is the root of my jekyll install in order to get ruby to read the migrator file that was there instead of trying to find one that wasn\'t.  I\'m sure the instructions will work fine for someone who knows more than me, but hey it worked.\r\n\r\n_edit: it now occurs to me that if I wanted this to really work the correct way, I should\'ve forked Matt Dipasquale\'s version of Jekyll and built my site that way, but I\'m not sure how that plays with the RubyGem system and in any event I made it work.  YMMV._\r\n\r\n##to give back unto the community...\r\n\r\nTODO - add a bit into the Drupal migrator that also liberates the URL aliases from the DB, as the author of the current migrator apparently used the stock Drupal URL scheme (node/\\*).  Jekyll has an easy facility for setting the permalinks for your posts, but going through every post to make sure they were right was needlessly tedious in hindsight.','##Reasons for leaving Drupal, a preamble\r\n\r\nI\'d had this website on Drupal since some time in July.

I\'ve said it here before, but it\'s likely that you weren\'t here for that - I went through a phase in college where I traveled all over the southeast going to see shows.  I didn\'t go to Phish shows except for a few times, and String Cheese was a bit after my time.  I and my buddies went to go see DJs.  This was the golden age of Keoki, Rabbit in the Moon, Simply Jeff, the Dubtribe Soundsystem, Scott Hardkiss..  My first party was to go see the Dubtribe at some club in Raleigh.  I couldn\'t figure out where the music was coming from the whole time, but it didn\'t matter because I danced my ass off all night long.  It was awesome.  \r\n\r\nAfter a year or two of this and getting more established in the Boone music scene as a bassist, it occurred to me one night that perhaps I should pick up a pair of decks and figure out how to rock the crowd like these guys do.  It was DJ Icey running the show at that particular time.  From [another post](/2009/04/file-under-random-memory/) - \r\n\r\n> I still remember this one record he played that night - the vocal hook was “can you feel the BASS”, and when the record said ‘bass’ there was this note that came out of the subs that can’t be related verbally. It shook the world. It made my hair stand up. It made the entire party, all 5000 of us, stop dancing and look around at each other.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, pretty much like this whole software quest but somewhat more informed, I began groping about for a style and a sound.  \r\n\r\n##Local influences\r\n\r\nI had two good buddies in Boone at the time that really helped inform my direction and encourage me to go for it.  Most of these style of music probably don\'t really exist anymore or have come to be called by different names, but [Matty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjUKQhYywAE \"YouTube - Matt Harder - The Basics (Cipster\'s \'Spontaneous Combustion\' Mix)\") was into the breakbeats (careful, that link is pretty hard).  My other buddy Breckenridge was more into downtempo and deep house.  Those two areas being covered, I began to search around for something that wasn\'t already being done.  There was quite a lively DJ scene in the the NC high country in the late 90s, and there were lots of drum and bass DJs around, so I turned the tempo down a bit.  I still wanted to rock the house, but in a smoother more subtle way.  Wasn\'t long before I found a mix CD by John Digweed.\r\n\r\n##The build\r\n\r\nI\'d attribute most of my love for music that \"jams\" to the crop of progressive house DJ/producers that England was churning out 10 years ago.  The main thing with that style of music is to lull your crowd into a trance (not like that [circuit-housey gay bar](http://www.google.com/search?q=backstreet+atlanta \"Google\") trance, but an actual state of hypnosis).  After about an hour or so of playing with them and giving them alternate chances to rest and whatnot, you start building over the course of a few records to a HUGE record.  This is where you kill them with your best bass line.  \r\n\r\nI learned two things from DJing - how to build a set over the course of a night and a metronomic sense of time and tempo.  The whole idea of mixing two records together without anyone else even noticing it\'s happening is something that really appealed to me, and requires a hell of a lot of skill to do well.  Your sense of time has to be perfect, you have to listen harder than almost any live musician has to (just realized that while writing this) in order to achieve the right blend and keep your records together, and you have a to have a good ear for pitch so that you don\'t clash two records together that are a minor second apart.  There\'s also quite a lot of acoustic theory to delve into on your mixer so that your two kick drums don\'t cancel each other out.  Good times.  So help me, some day I\'m going to get back over that way musically.  \r\n\r\nOther notable prog house influences - Steve Lawler, Dave Seaman, Danny Tenaglia, G Pal, Gui Boratto, Deep Dish, Sasha of course...\r\n\r\nGod, this blogging shit takes forever.

Maybe it\'s not an issue right now and maybe it won\'t be that big of one ever, but by inviting their fans to create a community around them using proprietary software that they\'ll never fully control they\'re rolling the dice that Ning (or whoever ultimately buys Ning) will continue to do them and their fans right.\r\n\r\n## In summary\r\n\r\nBetter to build your own site and use that as the hub around which you organize the rest of your social accessories.

Our physical manufacturing sector has been almost completely moved offshore.  This was done over a period of a couple of decades between Reagan and Bush II and was done for the sole reason of increasing corporate profits.  If it\'s cheaper to manufacture stuff somewhere they don\'t have a minimum wage, and the prices here stay the same, the company makes more money for it\'s shareholders.  This seems like a good thing, unless you\'re looking further than one fiscal quarter ahead.\r\n\r\nNow we have a situation where large Telecommunications companies have found a giant, largely unregulated loophole in the fastest growing sector of their business.  They\'d like for their share of the wireless spectrum to _remain_ largely unregulated so that they can carve it up how they want and charge for it what they want.  Seems fair, right?  But remember this is _our fucking AIR_ they\'re charging us to access.  They rightly realize that they majority of future internet use is going to take place over the airwaves, so best to get that sucker divvied up now and get the \"best practices\" in place for making as much money as they possibly can going forward.  (Makes me think of [this article](http://www.theonion.com/articles/american-people-hire-highpowered-lobbyist-to-push,18204/ \"American People Hire High-Powered Lobbyist To Push Interests In Congress | The Onion - America\'s Finest News Source\") from the Onion.)\r\n\r\nBest practices would include making damn sure they charge more money for popular web services once their customers come to depend on them.  I depend on Facebook to keep me in touch with most of the people I know on this planet.  It\'s surpassed \"social network\" status and become a utility.\r\n\r\nThis utility and others like it have become the center of American innovation, and the brightest hope for the future American economy.  Perhaps we won\'t be able to manufacture our way out of a recession, but maybe we can innovate ourselves out.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n> But Chile is trying a radical new experiment. ... It is importing entrepreneurs from all over the world, by offering them $40,000 to bootstrap in Chile.

All the entrepreneurs have to do, in return, is commit to working hard and live in one of the most beautiful places on this planet.\r\n\r\n~From a [Techcrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/18/chile%E2%80%99s-grand-innovation-experiment/ \"Chile’s Grand Innovation Experiment\") a few days ago.\r\n\r\n## Here\'s why you should be worried about Net Neutrality.\r\n\r\nIf you think for a second that America\'s place in this world as the center of creative innovation and hard working people making something from nothing is granted by the grace of God, _you might be right_.  But Verizon and the FCC may just make it impossible for even the will of God to overcome the long-term economic effects of giving these TelCom idiots what they want.  What they want is to milk as much money out of you and I as they possibly can, and they plan to do this by charging more for \"better, faster\" access to large internet companies that can supposedly afford it (while totally ignorant to the fact that the oldest and largest of any of these companies is barely 10 years old).\r\n\r\nWhere does this lead?\r\n\r\n1.  If the biggest internet companies pay more for their content to be delivered faster, then smaller companies and startups will have to use the \"plain old\" internet, which is what the entire internet is today.  \r\n\r\n2.  If big TelCom gets a pass to charge for faster access over a premium network, they most certainly won\'t have any incentive whatsoever to improve the \"plain old\" network.  \r\n\r\n3.  If countries like Chile are not just begging but _paying_ smart entrepreneurial types to move to their country and start businesses, they most certainly will.\r\n\r\n4.  Oh yeah, vastly higher bills for all of us.\r\n\r\nErgo, if technological innovation and brainpower have been this country\'s advantage over the rest of the world and you deliberately cripple technological innovation in the name of a few years of higher corporate profits, you can rest assured that the brainpower will flee this country to some place where it\'s more highly valued.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI\'ll leave you with a [few words from Steve Wozniak](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/steve-wozniak-to-the-fcc-keep-the-internet-free/68294/ \"Steve Wozniak to the FCC: Keep the Internet Free - Steve Wozniak - Technology - The Atlantic\"), co-founder of Apple.\r\n\r\n> I was brought up being told that one of the main purposes of our government is to help people who need help.

This seems like a good thing, unless you\'re looking further than one fiscal quarter ahead.\r\n\r\nNow we have a situation where large Telecommunications companies have found a giant, largely unregulated loophole in the fastest growing sector of their business.  They\'d like for their share of the wireless spectrum to _remain_ largely unregulated so that they can carve it up how they want and charge for it what they want.  Seems fair, right?  But remember this is _our fucking AIR_ they\'re charging us to access.  They rightly realize that they majority of future internet use is going to take place over the airwaves, so best to get that sucker divvied up now and get the \"best practices\" in place for making as much money as they possibly can going forward.','','1305549280','6');

I\'d been getting my indie rock fix from Death Cab and the Decemberists for the last couple of years and had never felt the urge to get any of their previous albums, but when their [web video for \"We Used To Wait\"](http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/ \"The Wilderness Downtown\") came out I couldn\'t stop watching it.  It\'s one of the most amazing things I\'ve seen done with the internet so far, and the tune behind the video was really good, too.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of weeks I bought the whole album, listened to it a few times and put it away.  It\'s only been over the last 6 weeks or so that I put it on repeat, and this is a fantastic record.  It\'s got the right mix of tunes that get you immediately and tunes that take a while to realize that you love (like every great album).

I didn\'t listen to much besides hip hop and dance music for the first several months of this year, but then a strange thing started happening.  Larry Keel would end up on repeat for several listens through his whole catalog.  I started going through Tony Rice\'s records, Bill Monroe\'s records..  I was having an urge I\'d never felt before - an urge to listen to and (gasp) play bluegrass.\r\n\r\nI\'d gotten the Stringduster\'s latest record and listened to it a few times while planting the garden, but at the time it was too produced for me.  It occurs to me now that maybe they\'re just too good and that\'s what I didn\'t really like at the time.\r\n\r\nI\'ve had this record on repeat for the last 4 months straight, and haven\'t gotten even close to burned out on it.  \r\n\r\n[It\'ll Be Alright](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ2bgU-X_tE \"YouTube - The Infamous Stringdusters -- It\'ll Be Alright\") from the Beachland Ballroom.

That\'d be so fun, but I\'ll never get to do it.  sigh...\r\n\r\n##\\#1 Big Boi - Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty\r\n\r\nGoing back and listening to some old Outkast I\'ve think I\'ve figured out that this is some sort of alter ego that he has in his tunes.  I never really got into Outkast except for a few tunes here and there, the big ones.  Hell, I probably only buy a hip hop record about once a year or so, so this is this year\'s entry.\r\n\r\nI first heard about this album on the NPR show \"Sound Opinions\".  I don\'t have much regard for music journalists in general (I don\'t mean you Tyler), but these guys have a really great show.  This record was featured on their show sometime over the summer and I liked what I heard, so I bought it.  It got it\'s hooks in immediately.  The first half of the album was the part that\'s immediately catchy on first listen, so I put it on repeat and rarely made it to the back nine.\r\n\r\nThe back half is where I spend much of my time lately.  This whole album is fantastic from front to back, maybe the best hip hop record for me since Kanye\'s Graduation.  The beats are awesome, the lyrics are hilarious, dirty, intelligible.  \r\n\r\n[Hustle Blood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs9mYwK0fF0 \"YouTube - Big Boi - 09 Hustle Blood - Sir Lucious Left Foot\").

I don\'t hate on Jon Bon Jovi, but I do hate on the misrepresentation of facts.  Steve Jobs didn\'t kill the music industry, the music industry killed the music industry.  Here\'s how.\r\n\r\nSome time in the early 80s record companies and stereo manufacturers (then known as HiFi) found themselves with a problem.  Record sales and HiFi sales were both flat.  The somewhat endless parade of new media formats, the same on that continues today with Blueray, had not found a new winner in a while.  People were still buying vinyl and cassettes.\r\n\r\nIt was at an AES convention that the CD was introduced to the world for the sole purpose of reviving back catalog and HiFi sales.  \"But it sounds like a turd\" was the general consensus among the crowd of professional audio engineers at AES.  Analog to digital conversion was in it\'s infancy and most early CDs sounded really brittle and really thin compared to their vinyl counterparts.  Sound familiar?  Anyway, because marketing is often more powerful than the truth especially when aimed at teenagers, the record companies got to work.  \"It\'s a perfect copy\", \"It\'ll never wear out\" was the message and it worked like a charm.  By the late 80s the CD was the dominant format and back catalog sales were humming along.\r\n\r\nPresumably nobody in marketing foresaw an age where digital information would be so easy to transfer, or more likely they figured by then it wouldn\'t be their problem.  \r\n\r\nNot going to get all Lefsetz about Napster and the subsequent reaction from the industry, but suffice to say that it was all coming down anyway and Apple was the company that put together a new model for distribution of a medium that was inevitable.  They didn\'t kill the music industry, you idiot.  You really think people would still be driving to Tower records to pick up [this shit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD2LRROpph0 \"YouTube  - Rebecca Black - Friday (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\")?','> Well unsurprisingly, even after several _minutes_ of Google searching I\'m unable to dig into the real article on this one, only countless verbatim reposts on countless web-scraping sites.\r\n>\r\n> Anyway, [here\'s an example](http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2011/03/15/17616986-wenn-story.html \"Steve Jobs killed music: Bon Jovi | Music | Entertainment | Toronto Sun\").  I don\'t hate on Jon Bon Jovi, but I do hate on the misrepresentation of facts.  Steve Jobs didn\'t kill the music industry, the music industry killed the music industry.  Here\'s how.\r\n\r\nSome time in the early 80s record companies and stereo manufacturers (then known as HiFi) found themselves with a problem.  Record sales and HiFi sales were both flat.  The somewhat endless parade of new media formats, the same on that continues today with Blueray, had not found a new winner in a while.  People were still buying vinyl and cassettes.\r\n\r\nIt was at an AES convention that the CD was introduced to the world for the sole purpose of reviving back catalog and HiFi sales.  \"But it sounds like a turd\" was the general consensus among the crowd of professional audio engineers at AES.  Analog to digital conversion was in it\'s infancy and most early CDs sounded really brittle and really thin compared to their vinyl counterparts.  Sound familiar?  Anyway, because marketing is often more powerful than the truth especially when aimed at teenagers, the record companies got to work.  \"It\'s a perfect copy\", \"It\'ll never wear out\" was the message and it worked like a charm.  By the late 80s the CD was the dominant format and back catalog sales were humming along.\r\n\r\nPresumably nobody in marketing foresaw an age where digital information would be so easy to transfer, or more likely they figured by then it wouldn\'t be their problem.','','1305549652','6');

I\'d like to share a couple of things that I\'ve come up with.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, to get anywhere in this business, to get anywhere sustainably that is, takes a really long time.  There is no short circuiting this process, short of selling your soul to the devil.  Even bands like the Black Eyed Peas who are on top of the world right now in 2011 have been doing this since I was just getting started.  Acts like Ke$ha stand out in my mind as pure product, and this post isn\'t addressed to acts like her.  This is addressed to bands like the Dusters or Yarn or any of the other top-notch acts out there busting their asses in a van every day of the year.  \r\n\r\nThere *is* a sustainable livelihood to be made in this corner of the music business.  What it takes more than anything is time and hard work.  I\'ve seen and worked with other musicians who acted as if their success were a God given right, that their talent would ensure them a livelihood whenever the proper magic hit-maker type came along and granted them the keys.  These musicians are generally bitter, bad drunks and best avoided.  You may be able to shave a certain percentage of time off your ascent by being smarter and by putting forethought into your career path, but by and large it\'s game of patience and being pleasant to work with.  \"If you sit at the table long enough, you will get fed.\"\r\n\r\nSecond, and this primarily applies to sidemen, it\'s good to cultivate an aspect of your playing that is considered mainstream.  That is to say, if you are a bluegrass bass player with a penchant for Airto-era Return To Forever, it\'s okay to slip those leading samba-type Stanley grace notes into your 1-5-1-5.  Just make sure that you don\'t do it all the time and if the very well respected banjo player that is sitting in with your band looks at you funny, that\'s a clue.  If you are a classically trained musician turned bluegrass player, by all means slip as much of that style in there as you want, but know how to chop that thing, too.  Keeping this in mind as you make your rounds will render you much more hirable for your next gig.  You are thinking about your next gig, aren\'t you?\r\n\r\nFin for now.
