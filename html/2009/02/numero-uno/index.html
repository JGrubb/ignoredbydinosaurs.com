  	<p>To speak into the void.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve had this idea simmering on the front burner of my brain for several months now. But first, I should probably introduce myself, or do a bio, or something. Maybe this will take several parts, because I&#8217;ve never tried to write a bio, and I feel like I&#8217;ve done a good job living unconventionally with my first 30 years here&#8230;</p>

<p>I was born in ATL, Georgia, that is. No brothers or sisters. Great parents. Always totally behind me for some reason. I got pretty mediocre grades at the private school they sent me to, and spent most of my time getting in trouble. Nothing big ever, no real cause for concern, I just didn&#8217;t really feel like fitting into their mold over there. I realize now in hindsight that I left high school with pretty low self esteem after being told for half of my life what an underachiever I was, how much potential I had that if I just &#8220;applied myself&#8221;. I had some really good friends, though, and at some point found music.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d been in the school band since 6th grade, trombone. I realize now that I never knew how to read music. I think I learned the parts by listening to whomever I was sitting next to. That amazes me in hindsight, but nobody picked up on it, least of all me. I was that into the trombone anyway, I was much more into the drums. I used to get on my band directors nerve because as soon as we got into the room I&#8217;d be back in the percussion section, not learning the trombone parts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you just switch to percussion?&#8221; you might ask..</p>

<p>&#8220;Because we need trombones&#8221; was the answer I got for years and years whenever I asked to switch to percussion.</p>

<p>There was one time that I was really into building model planes. I didn&#8217;t use plastic cement, for some reason I used a hot glue gun. It was messy and my models turned out looking like crap, but that&#8217;s not the point. One time I&#8217;d set my glue gun down, with it pointing into my glass of water. It had dripped some hot glue into the glass, apparently, right before I took a sip. I burned the crap out of my top lip and had a huge ugly scab for weeks. The band concert was coming up that week. I couldn&#8217;t play the trombone. I got to be a percussionist for a week. It was like heaven. I couldn&#8217;t read music for the bass drum either, but I damn sure could make the part up. Nobody ever knew, and I never told them. I totally forgot about that until now.</p>

<p>Anyway, I forget why, but at some point I got more or less kicked out of the band. I think I skipped a mandatory concert to go on a youth group trip with my church. I asked them if I could skip the concert to go on a youth group trip and they said &#8220;no&#8221;. This would&#8217;ve been a reasonable answer, except that five minutes before my best friends James had asked them if he could go on the exact same trip that I was asking to go on, and they told him &#8220;sure&#8221;. So I went anyway. Now I remember why. Amazing this blogging&#8230;</p>

<p>Anyway, now I&#8217;m in a band, and right now I&#8217;m on a tour bus heading to the GA theater in Athens. I&#8217;ve got some time to kill, so I&#8217;ll keep catching you up, whoever you are. At this rate, I&#8217;ll get to my big idea in another 20 posts or so.</p>
