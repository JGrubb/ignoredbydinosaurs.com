  <p><time>26 Feb 2009</time></p>
	<div class="text">
  	<p>I started running about this time last year. I hadn&#8217;t exercised regularly since college, where they gave you gym access along with your tuition. I spent the rest of my 20s gaining about 2 or 3 pounds a year, and not really doing much in the way of taking care of myself. It had occurred to me that the only exercise I was really ever going to be able to afford was running, but I <i>hate</i> running. I kept up this hope that some day I was going to be able to at least join a YMCA with a pool or something, as that was much more my speed.</p>

<p>I had a big winter last year, with the birth of my baby boy right in the middle of it. I had the same realization that I had had in college 11 years earlier - that one simple little thing that I could that would make me feel better was to start getting some regular exercise again. So I dug my running shoes out of the closet, as I had tried this before, and got started. The first mile isn&#8217;t as hard as the second mile. And it must&#8217;ve taken me six months of plugging away at just running those two miles without stopping, but once I got over the hump, I really got over the hump.</p>

<p>My short run around where I live is right at 4 miles long, and I try to do that every other day when the weather allows. I start getting really antsy if I go more than a week. Without a shadow of a doubt, I&#8217;m in the best shape I&#8217;ve ever been in. I lost the pounds and then some, and haven&#8217;t really relapsed at all as far as bad eating habits. My wife Michelle is a veg, so it&#8217;s easy when I&#8217;m home, but I&#8217;ve managed to keep at it on the road with greater and greater success. I got up yesterday at 7:30 and went for about 3.5 with my buddy Matt, and then did another 3 or so here in Charleston. As you can tell, this is about nothing in particular, but if you hate running as bad as I did, there&#8217;s a very good chance that you could love it as much as I do now&#8230;</p>
