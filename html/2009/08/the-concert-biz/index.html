<article class="blog">
  <p>I read a piece the other day that really irritated the holy crap out of me. An acquaintance had posted a link to <a href='http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2009/08/02/the-concert-business/'>this article</a> proclaiming the &#8220;implosion of the concert business&#8221;. The examples he cites - Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, U2 - are all apparently seeing a downturn in their ticket sales for their most recent runs. This is not surprising to me and I assumed that it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to anyone, but according to Mr. Lefsetz it&#8217;s a cause of concern for many a concert promoting Dinosaur.</p>

<p>This is the section that really kills me :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe no one cares to the equivalent of a multiplatinum level anymore. Maybe the live business has to give that paradigm up. At least for a decade, until new acts are grown.</p>

<p>We want music that resonates. And we want music. Lady GaGa is outfits. Katy Perry is so second rate she’s third rate. The future looks more like the Kings Of Leon. A band that’s been around for years that finally breaks through. And doesn’t break the bank when it sets ticket prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, ignoring the casual inattention to building proper sentences, he does make a salient point. If&#8217;n there is a decline in the overall concert business, it&#8217;s obviously a parallel to the decline in the record business. I do believe that P2P sharing played a part in killing the record business of yore, but no more than the CD-R, no more than the laptop computer, and certainly not as much as the overall disposable quality of pop music over the last 15 years. People don&#8217;t want to see those acts live. And the Kings of Leon? They&#8217;re the future? So, the future looks exactly like the past - young, pretty kids that sound and act like the Rolling Stones that have a sugar-coated and easily swallowed press story. Kill yourself.</p>

<p>The reason that this depresses me is that the entire music business still views itself through the same lens that it has for the last 20 years - huge amounts of money to be made from relatively little effort, and if it doesn&#8217;t pay off there are a hundred other candidates waiting to get in line for their shot. Not a single thought is paid to building a business (act) in the time tested manner that every other business has to go through in order to turn a long-term profit. The Police didn&#8217;t do much on their first two albums, but 2 years after that they were the biggest act in the world. Luckily their label didn&#8217;t dump them, or who would headline Bonnaroo 25 years on?</p>

<p>Just a side question - Who&#8217;s gonna play the Super Bowl Half Time show in 10 years? Death Cab for Cutie?</p>
