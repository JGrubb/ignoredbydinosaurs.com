    <p>It feels like ages since my last post, even though I&#8217;ve tried to keep it up with some links to some good dorkery. Today is spent in the bus, driving the 735 miles from Denver to Columbia, MO. We left at 9 this morning and have made a small dent in Kansas, but we&#8217;ll most likely be rolling in around midnight or so tonight. So here goes&#8230;</p>

<p>Yesterday was spent at the Mile High Music Festival in Denver, one of our hometowns. It was kind of a strange lineup - us, Ani, Ben Harper, Tool, Panic, Black Keys, India Arie. Sort of like a festival we do all the time, but not exactly. I can&#8217;t explain it without sounding like I&#8217;m getting down on the festival, but it was sorta like Rothbury without all the vibe. Now, Rothbury, there&#8217;s a festival. My friend Laura has a great blog about her involvement with the copious vibe-ification that took place. Check it out <a href='http://shaktisunfire.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/rothbury-2009/'>here</a>. It&#8217;s not kosher for me to be proclaiming any festival the &#8220;best&#8221;, but if it were&#8230;</p>

<p>Festival season aside, I&#8217;ve pretty much just been at work on Railroad Earth&#8217;s next website. After months of research, I&#8217;ve pretty well settled on WordPress as the platform and have been building for the last few weeks, talking to numerous developers and designers that can help with the look - the backend and build-out has pretty much become my baby. I&#8217;m very excited about it. I&#8217;d tell you where it&#8217;s stashed, but not only do I want it to be a surprise to as many people as possible, the metrics tell me that perhaps a few of you have already found it.</p>

<p>Pardon my lack of anything interesting to say, but my creative fire seems to go in cycles. I&#8217;ve had to venture into the woods for more firewood lately, and will hopefully have more to say one of these days.</p>
