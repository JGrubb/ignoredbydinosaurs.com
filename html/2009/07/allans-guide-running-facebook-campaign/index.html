<article class="blog">
  <p>Well, friends, I asked for it. Yesterday I put up a post about Facebook&#8217;s new SMS fan feature. This lets RRE fans (or whomever) text &#8220;fan RailroadEarth&#8221; to FBOOK and they&#8217;re automatically added to our fan roster on Facebook. This sounds like an extremely convenient way to sign up new fans at a show or whenever the feeling hits them, yet there are a few hurtles from an effective marketing perspective that I wanted some feedback on. For instance, the best way to get the word out would probably be to make an announcement from the stage during the show, but RRE isn&#8217;t going to be doing that. Whatever the vibe is that we&#8217;re trying to project from stage, it ain&#8217;t the one where we stop in the middle of a set and put in a plug for our <a href='http://www.facebook.com/railroadearth'>Facebook page</a>.</p>

<p>Other alternatives are placing info at the merch booth, the ubiquitous (and potentially ineffective) email blast, but obviously a coordinated effort on all fronts would be the most effective means of getting those numbers up. A coordinated effort is what Allan came up with. I&#8217;d love to hog this as proprietary information given to us, and only us, by a seasoned marketing vet for the purpose of blowing Railroad Earth up just a little bit more. However, that would be against the <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/about-ibd/'>stated mission of ignoredByDinosaurs</a>. What I present here is either something that he&#8217;d been working on for months and waiting for the right opportunity to fire off or a 30 minute rough draft of a brainstorm. You never know with that guy. Either way, he&#8217;s an impassioned student of the biz and this is good stuff. If you promote bands you should read this.</p>

<p>The funny part is, I was just kidding when I asked him to make me a diagram.</p>
