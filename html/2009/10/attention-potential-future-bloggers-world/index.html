  <p>It appears that the creative fire feels like being spent on writing again, finally. So if may I impart a bit of what I&#8217;ve learned in the last few months&#8230;</p>

<p>Before you set up that Blogspot account, I just want to call your attention to a few of the other offerings out there. Blogger/Blogspot is an extremely simple way to get going, but there are even simpler ways to get going, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going for. There are also offerings out there that will allow you a much greater amount of flexibility in what you do with your new blog, should you want to go bigger. And now&#8230;</p>

<p>My new favorite social website is <a href='http://www.tumblr.com/'>Tumblr</a>, hands down. Right there on the front page of the site, in 40 pt font is the slogan &#8220;the easiest way to blog&#8221;. I&#8217;d have to agree. You don&#8217;t have to give them anything about your identity if you don&#8217;t want, and you can create your own subdomain, just like Blogger. What Tumblr has over Blogger is a much more refined design. There are a bunch of templates to choose from, just like Blogger, but I find them to be a little more easy on the eyes, and thus easier to read and navigate - all important to the blogging experience, wouldn&#8217;t you say? If all you want to do is start letting some of your thoughts out of your head in blog form, give it a whirl. Oh yeah, you can point <a href='http://johnnygrubb.com/'>your own domain</a> at Tumblr instead of using whatever.tumblr.com as your URL.</p>

<p>If you need to build something a little more extensive, say a website for your classroom&#8217;s parents to keep up with their kids and their activities, I&#8217;d highly recommend <a href='http://wordpress.com/'>Wordpress.com</a>. They too have a number of different design templates to choose from (though not as many as Tumblr), so setting up a blog that feels like you isn&#8217;t too much of a challenge. The great thing about Wordpress, the framework on which this website also runs, is that you can build outward. Say you want to have a contact page, and a calendar of events on another page, etc, you can do that pretty easily (and quickly) with Wordpress. Hopefully my buddy Jimmy doesn&#8217;t mind my linking to <a href='http://mrsapia108.wordpress.com/'>his classroom website</a> as a fantastic example of what a smart person can do with WordPress in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>You really should have a blog by this point. Make it recipes or pictures or whatever, but it&#8217;s free and it&#8217;s fun. Just do it&#8230;</p>
