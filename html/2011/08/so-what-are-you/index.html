<article class="blog">
  <p>So here I sit, at the end of another brief tour, watching the sky get lighter outside the windows at the St. Louis airport. Listening to a bit of the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Bon-Iver/dp/B004XE0P5E/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1314015521&sr=8-4'>new Bon Iver record</a>, which is beyond terrific to the point of being maybe the record of the year for me. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I haven&#8217;t had much to say (though I haven&#8217;t had quite <em>as much</em> to say), it&#8217;s just that the time in which I used to say it has been filled by the consequence of my prayers for work being answered. I&#8217;ve been very, very busy this year and not a moment too soon. I jumped off my last gig in desperation; desperation at a job that I just wasn&#8217;t feeling anymore and that finally qualified itself as being the wrong path. To wander that far down a path such as that one and then decide to bushwhack my way back up to where I could see the landscape again was a life/career move I&#8217;d probably have considered a bit more carefully had I known just how hard it would be. The undergrowth was dense. The way was dark. Had I not found the way back to be already overgrown I&#8217;d probably have turned around and asked for my old job back. Or maybe not.</p>

<p>Forgive all the flashy metaphor, but I&#8217;ve just driven 4 hours to the airport after a gig in the middle of Nowheresville, Missouri and I&#8217;ve got the perfect balance of coffee buzz, time, exhaustion, and an itch to write.</p>

<p>So anyway, I get the title question a lot this year. In short -</p>

<p>I split RRE with grand ideas and a grander mouth to broadcast them. The crusade was to put together the solution to the music industries problem. Because there weren&#8217;t enough smart, capable, connected people working on the issue already, apparently. Part of last year&#8217;s journey was a pretty extreme pruning of my ego, and it hurt. I had (and still sort of have) a pretty good idea about an open source angle to the music business that hasn&#8217;t been done before, in my opinion because it explicitly doesn&#8217;t make anyone any money except for the artists who implement the solution. I had a few other people convinced it was at least part of a good idea, and a few of them were kind enough to trot me in front of business types who could give me some feedback. The conversation generally ended shortly after they asked me &#8220;so how does it make money?&#8221;. Well, the idea is that it doesn&#8217;t make <em>you</em> money. Kthx.</p>

<p>I understand of course, and learned a hell of a lot about early stage startups in the process of all this. Chiefly, I learned that I was seriously lacking in the ability to implement <em>any</em> ideas that I might have, either now or in the future. So I decided to fall back and work on what I could work on, which I chose to be the technical end of the equation. Always was good with computers.</p>

<p>I picked up a very few clients last year, those who were desperate enough to hire me. I went to a few networking things, mostly centered around <a href='/2010/06/ignored-dinosaurs-3'>Drupal</a>, and went to several job interviews. I received some fairly harsh smackdowns at these interviews, typically during the technical part of the interview, and did not receive any jobs.</p>

<p>Somewhere around last November I was pretty damn close to the edge of &#8220;all I could take&#8221;. That&#8217;s when I saw the ENB gig up for grabs, so I grabbed it. It wasn&#8217;t much (by design) but it was a direction, it was good music with guys I already knew, it was at least a tiny bit of income. I started in February.</p>

<p>About 10 days into my tenure with ENB, I got a couple of emails on the same day that have turned out to be all the work I need. But it didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>

<p>Somehow in the process of all this, I&#8217;ve become a fairly well-rounded, intermediate programmer, and one who has a pretty good sense of how to figure out the infinite number of problems that he&#8217;s never encountered before. I&#8217;ve learned more programming languages, acronyms, protocols, tools, toolkits, best practices and shortcuts for being an effective (hireable) programmer than I could&#8217;ve guessed I&#8217;d be capable of. In April something amazing happened. I had a technical interview for a freelance gig based out of Austin TX that went astonishingly well. We talked about <a href='http://git-scm.com/'>Git</a> and <a href='http://drupal.org/'>Drupal</a> and <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/'>Ruby</a> and handwriting <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL'>SQL</a> for half an hour. It was <em>fun</em>. I got the gig, and that was the little gig I got that month. I&#8217;ve been getting gigs left and right all year. It&#8217;s insane. It&#8217;s wonderful.</p>

<p>So basically, I&#8217;m making about 90% of my income on this computer here, and I do the ENB thing for fun and to stay connected and relevant to the scene I really care about. I&#8217;ve been in technical woodshedding mode all year, but I sense that it&#8217;s about time to start trying to crack the nut that beat me this time last year. I&#8217;ve had a few things fall in my lap in the last couple weeks that are pointing me in that direction again, to try and see what I can come up with that could contribute to the music scene. I&#8217;m not trying to &#8220;save&#8221; it anymore. I&#8217;m not really sure that &#8220;saving&#8221; the music industry is what needs to happen right now anyway. As much as I am completely in LOVE with Spotify for the last month, they pay the artists about 1/10 of a piece of dog shit for royalties on the tunes that they stream. Nobody could make a living on what they pay out. Excuse me, no <em>artist</em> could ever make a living on what they pay out. I hear the labels have found a way to keep making nice profits in the midst of all this supposed bloodshed. So the brass ring is still sitting there, waiting to be grabbed.</p>
