  <h2 class="post-title">On Joining A Band</h2>
  <p><time>15 Jan 2011</time></p>
	<div class="text">
  	<p>Hi. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of weeks. I&#8217;ve been on the road for the last week driving myself all over the northeast with Tao Seegar, George Kilby, Andrew McConathy and a couple of other dudes in what has turned out to be a warm up run for rejoining music playing society in a couple of weeks. I always write the best blog posts about the most elaborately thoughtful and incisive topics when I&#8217;m driving and listening to music. No, really! Alas, as my hands are usually full at the time, most of them go by never being committed to bytes. However, I&#8217;ve had lots of time to sit and think this week about what motivates me professionally.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been reading some of the reaction to the recent announcement of my joining up with a new band in a few weeks. Pretty much as I expected - mostly support but at least one saying something like <em>&#8220;wuh? I thought he was leaving to blah blah blah. He&#8217;s full of blah blah blah.&#8221;</em> I haven&#8217;t been digging that hard. Anyway, that post was actually pretty helpful in terms of jolting me into a mindset of wanting to explain myself, which ultimately leads me to really set out for myself what I&#8217;m doing, why, and what the big plan is. A huge part of laying out a successful plan is knowing when to improvise. So it goes.</p>

<p>I did say I was leaving to go do something else. I did specifically name software development as that other thing that I was interested in pursuing career-wise, <em>but</em>&#8230; I never, ever, ever said I was done playing music or that I would never go on the road again. I thought the subtext of my big quitting RRE announcement was pretty clear. It just wasn&#8217;t fun anymore, and it wasn&#8217;t fair to anyone to keep pretending that it was. I said that my plans got rearranged when this new record deal popped up and that I&#8217;d be leaning on my faith a lot in the coming year as I tried to sort out what to do after being in a successful band that was going to be hard to top creatively.</p>

<p>Faith is a hard thing to keep up. There were a few points last year where I wasn&#8217;t really sure how I was going to make it out of this world alive. Not playing music was something I needed to do as a process of detox from the RRE experience, but not playing music was also leaving the pressure relief valve on my head closed for an indeterminate amount of time.</p>

<p>I scrounged around and found some good dev work. I fired my first client. I learned how to work up good quotes. I learned how much job interviewing totally sucks and that nobody cares about what you did over there and how much you have to contribute. Then toward the end of last year I came across a free book on learning Python that had some really relevant advice&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but if you want to make about the same money and be happier, you could actually just go run a fast food joint. You are much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.</p>

<p>People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.</p>

<p>~ from <a href='http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index' title='Learn Python The Hard Way: Learn Python The Hard Way'>Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8230;which was pretty much the plan all along. The only reason I was interviewing for these faceless jobs that have nothing to do with the music business in the first place is because of the very real financial pressures on a 32 year old with 2 kids in the middle of the worst economy in 400,000 years. There&#8217;s a lot of programming work out there. I&#8217;ll have the resume and experience to write my own ticket in another year or two, and I suspect that I&#8217;ll have found the proper application for my skills inside the music industry by then.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I obviously couldn&#8217;t have planned this Emmitt Nershi thing, and that&#8217;s where the faith part comes in.</p>

<p>I had the hardest and best year of my life last year. I got to be home with my boys and my wife for the first time ever. I got to establish rituals and bond with my kids in a way that I know there&#8217;s <em>absolutely no way I could&#8217;ve had I still been on the road</em>. I got to step out of a scene that I love but that also has a considerable dark side in it&#8217;s effects on your/my psyche. To voluntarily step out of a job where people clapped and cheered and showed up in droves even when the job was done less-than-stellar was a good move. It was a lot like pruning back my ego. I heartily recommend it for all musicians.</p>

<p>And now a gig presents itself that has potential to strike a much healthier balance for me personally and give me the time to continue to grow and diversify professionally, to put back to work all of the connections and skills that I&#8217;ve developed over the years. So yes, I jumped at it.</p>
