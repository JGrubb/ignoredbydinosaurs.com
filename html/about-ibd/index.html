<p>ignoredByDinosaurs is an idea at this point. It was born out of a long held notion that someone somewhere must have an idea about where the music industry is headed. I&#8217;ve held this belief for so long while living my life as a musician and artist and student of culture and society that I&#8217;ve kissed it goodbye. I realized about a year ago that nobody anywhere even had a clue, never mind a plan that saved what was worth saving about the music industry - the music part.</p>

<p>Not long after that I was riding in a van on the way to a gig in Maine when the phrase &#8220;ignored by dinosaurs&#8221; popped into my head. That&#8217;s what we are, after all. I thought it was a stupid name then, but it stuck, and I never came up with one that better encapsulated the feeling I had that the point and the solution were being hugely missed. I&#8217;d already begun my self-education in software development, so later that week I bought the domain. Here we are</p>

<p>In the months since then, the concept has morphed and grown, but the idea has stayed the same. <em>If the music business is ever going to be saved, if musicians are ever going to be allowed a chance to achieve a minimum standard of living, if we are going to rescue music itself from it&#8217;s place as today&#8217;s disposable trinket and restore it&#8217;s place as the universal human language, then the paradigm has got to be completely and utterly reinvented.</em> That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here to do. Thanks for joining me.</p>
