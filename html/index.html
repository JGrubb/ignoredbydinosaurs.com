				<blockquote>
<p>As business models go, there are currently two dominant ones: either people like your product enough to purchase it or they don’t care enough to buy it but will overlook its deficiencies if it’s “free” in exchange for their personal browsing and purchasing info sold to advertisers. The former model is Apple’s, the latter is Google’s.</p>

<p>Apple sells emotional experiences. The price is what users pay to be delighted by Apple’s stream of innovations and to be free of the lowest common denominator burdens and the pervasive harvesting of their personal info.</p>

<p>Google sells eyeballs. To be more precise, the clickstream attached to those eyeballs. Thus scale, indeed dominance, is absolutely crucial to Google’s model.</p>

				<h2 id='3_arcade_fire__the_suburbs'>#3 Arcade Fire - The Suburbs</h2> <p>I&#8217;ve never listened to these guys before. I&#8217;d been getting my indie rock fix from Death Cab and the Decemberists for the last couple of years and had never felt the urge to get any of their previous albums, but when their <a href='http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/' title='The Wilderness Downtown'>web video for &#8220;We Used To Wait&#8221;</a> came out I couldn&#8217;t stop watching it. It&#8217;s one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve seen done with the internet so far, and the tune behind the video was really good, too.</p> <p>After a couple of weeks I bought the whole album, listened to it a few times and put it away. It&#8217;s only been over the last 6 weeks or so that I put it on repeat, and this is a fantastic record. It&#8217;s got the right mix of tunes that get you immediately and tunes that take a while to realize that you love (like every great album). <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqnvaWZ-JA' title='YouTube - Arcade Fire - Month Of May'>The Month of May</a> in particular is custom made for setting record times on your jog&#8230;</p> <h2 id='2_infamous_stringdusters__things_that_fly'>#2 Infamous Stringdusters - Things That Fly</h2> <p>After I quit my last gig, I was feeling a little burned out on acoustic music. I didn&#8217;t listen to much besides hip hop and dance music for the first several months of this year, but then a strange thing started happening. Larry Keel would end up on repeat for several listens through his whole catalog. I started going through Tony Rice&#8217;s records, Bill Monroe&#8217;s records.. I was having an urge I&#8217;d never felt before - an urge to listen to and (gasp) play bluegrass.</p> <p>I&#8217;d gotten the Stringduster&#8217;s latest record and listened to it a few times while planting the garden, but at the time it...

			<div class="text">
				<blockquote> <p>Just a week before the FCC holds a vote on whether to apply fairness rules to some of the nation’s internet service providers, two companies that sell their services to the country’s largest cellular companies showed off a different vision of the future: one where you’ll have to pay extra to watch YouTube or use Facebook.</p> </blockquote> <p>~From a <a href='http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/carriers-net-neutrality-tiers/' title='Mobile Carriers Dream of Charging per Page &amp;#124; Epicenter&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124; Wired.com'>Wired article</a> earlier this week. <strong>READ IT</strong></p> <h2 id='now_heres_why_this_matters'>Now here&#8217;s why this matters&#8230;</h2> <p>It&#8217;s not about Facebook or YouTube. Those seem on the surface like silly trifles and why shouldn&#8217;t we have to pay more for silly trifles, right? Because those silly, time-sucking trifles represent present-day American innovation. Our physical manufacturing sector has been almost completely moved offshore. This was done over a period of a couple of decades between Reagan and Bush II and was done for the sole reason of increasing corporate profits. If it&#8217;s cheaper to manufacture stuff somewhere they don&#8217;t have a minimum wage, and the prices here stay the same, the company makes more money for it&#8217;s shareholders. This seems like a good thing, unless you&#8217;re looking further than one fiscal quarter ahead.</p> <p>Now we have a situation where large Telecommunications companies have found a giant, largely unregulated loophole in the fastest growing sector of their business. They&#8217;d like for their share of the wireless spectrum to <em>remain</em> largely unregulated so that they can carve it up how they want and charge for it what they want. Seems fair, right? But remember this is <em>our fucking AIR</em> they&#8217;re charging us to access. They rightly realize that they majority of future internet use is going to take place over the airwaves, so best to get that sucker divvied up now and get the &#8220;best practices&#8221;...

				<h2 id='i_was_having_this_conversation_on_saturday'>I was having this conversation on Saturday&#8230;</h2> <p>I&#8217;m hanging with my new musical buddy George Kilby. He&#8217;s decided to upgrade his website so we&#8217;re doing a consult to get a feel for what direction we&#8217;re going to move him in (pardon my grammar). He said something at one point about a friend of his who&#8217;d decided to totally forgo having their own website in favor of just managing their presence through Facebook and a couple of other social sites.</p> <p>I&#8217;m kicking myself for not having a canned response as to why I think that&#8217;s a bad idea, but I guess i hadn&#8217;t really thought about it too much in a while.</p> <h2 id='in_my_humble_opinion'>In my humble opinion&#8230;</h2> <p>I can totally understand why an artist would do that. It&#8217;s a hassle to manage your own website. There&#8217;s tons of traffic already happening for free over on Facebook, they already have most of the goodies that a band website needs to have built for you, and you&#8217;ve got to spend half your life posting all this crap there <em>again</em> anyway. Why not just skip the middle man?</p> <p>To me it&#8217;s two things - branding and informational liberty.</p> <h3 id='branding'>Branding</h3> <p>If you fold up your own website and just manage your presence through mySpace or Facebook or Reverb Nation, you&#8217;re effectively subordinating your brand to theirs. I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that you are bigger than Facebook, but to me it almost implies that Facebook or MySpace owns you if you send your potential fans there instead of a property of your own. Would a &#8220;normal&#8221; business send people to MySpace instead of having their own site? No! They want to <em>make</em> money&#8230;</p> <h3 id='informational_liberty'>Informational liberty</h3> <p>I have some friends in a band. They&#8217;ve moved their main website onto a platform called Ning....
