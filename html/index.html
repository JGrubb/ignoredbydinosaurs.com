				<p>I suppose there&#8217;s a few ways a post with this title could go. I&#8217;m flying back from my first run with the new band, and there were a few themes bouncing around for me the last couple weeks. This band is a lot lower overhead. There&#8217;s no bus call. There&#8217;s no soundguy (although I personally hope that&#8217;s remedied this year). Load in and setup takes about 15 minutes. Billy and Drew managed to work out lift passes for us to all get out on the mountain 3 times in the last two weeks. I grew up skiing a lot in the Rockies with my folks, but had basically taken a 13 year hiatus. The last time I&#8217;d been on a mountain was about 5 years ago on the Honkytonk/Railroad tour in 2006, so I had forgotten how much I love skiing until about 100 yards into our first run at Jackson Hole (an amazing mountain).</p>

<p>I miss my family quite a lot. We&#8217;d all gotten used to my being home and a cell phone is a poor substitute for a hug. I can already see where that&#8217;s going to be a problem again, but I&#8217;m hoping that this gig remains a nice, steady, part-time thing because I really like the music. The guys are very nice guys, I&#8217;m meeting all manner of the CO scene; already collecting some funny stories about the things you&#8217;d expect there&#8217;d be funny stories about.</p>

<p>It feels so good to have a bass in my hands. I&#8217;m really thankful.</p>

				<p>Hi. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of weeks. I&#8217;ve been on the road for the last week driving myself all over the northeast with Tao Seegar, George Kilby, Andrew McConathy and a couple of other dudes in what has turned out to be a warm up run for rejoining music playing society in a couple of weeks. I always write the best blog posts about the most elaborately thoughtful and incisive topics when I&#8217;m driving and listening to music. No, really! Alas, as my hands are usually full at the time, most of them go by never being committed to bytes. However, I&#8217;ve had lots of time to sit and think this week about what motivates me professionally.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve been reading some of the reaction to the recent announcement of my joining up with a new band in a few weeks. Pretty much as I expected - mostly support but at least one saying something like <em>&#8220;wuh? I thought he was leaving to blah blah blah. He&#8217;s full of blah blah blah.&#8221;</em> I haven&#8217;t been digging that hard. Anyway, that post was actually pretty helpful in terms of jolting me into a mindset of wanting to explain myself, which ultimately leads me to really set out for myself what I&#8217;m doing, why, and what the big plan is. A huge part of laying out a successful plan is knowing when to improvise. So it goes.</p> <p>I did say I was leaving to go do something else. I did specifically name software development as that other thing that I was interested in pursuing career-wise, <em>but</em>&#8230; I never, ever, ever said I was done playing music or that I would never go on the road again. I thought the subtext of my big quitting RRE announcement was pretty clear. It just wasn&#8217;t...

				<blockquote>
<p>As business models go, there are currently two dominant ones: either people like your product enough to purchase it or they don’t care enough to buy it but will overlook its deficiencies if it’s “free” in exchange for their personal browsing and purchasing info sold to advertisers. The former model is Apple’s, the latter is Google’s.</p>

<p>Apple sells emotional experiences. The price is what users pay to be delighted by Apple’s stream of innovations and to be free of the lowest common denominator burdens and the pervasive harvesting of their personal info.</p>

<p>Google sells eyeballs. To be more precise, the clickstream attached to those eyeballs. Thus scale, indeed dominance, is absolutely crucial to Google’s model.</p>

				<h2 id='3_arcade_fire__the_suburbs'>#3 Arcade Fire - The Suburbs</h2> <p>I&#8217;ve never listened to these guys before. I&#8217;d been getting my indie rock fix from Death Cab and the Decemberists for the last couple of years and had never felt the urge to get any of their previous albums, but when their <a href='http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/' title='The Wilderness Downtown'>web video for &#8220;We Used To Wait&#8221;</a> came out I couldn&#8217;t stop watching it. It&#8217;s one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve seen done with the internet so far, and the tune behind the video was really good, too.</p> <p>After a couple of weeks I bought the whole album, listened to it a few times and put it away. It&#8217;s only been over the last 6 weeks or so that I put it on repeat, and this is a fantastic record. It&#8217;s got the right mix of tunes that get you immediately and tunes that take a while to realize that you love (like every great album). <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqnvaWZ-JA' title='YouTube - Arcade Fire - Month Of May'>The Month of May</a> in particular is custom made for setting record times on your jog&#8230;</p> <h2 id='2_infamous_stringdusters__things_that_fly'>#2 Infamous Stringdusters - Things That Fly</h2> <p>After I quit my last gig, I was feeling a little burned out on acoustic music. I didn&#8217;t listen to much besides hip hop and dance music for the first several months of this year, but then a strange thing started happening. Larry Keel would end up on repeat for several listens through his whole catalog. I started going through Tony Rice&#8217;s records, Bill Monroe&#8217;s records.. I was having an urge I&#8217;d never felt before - an urge to listen to and (gasp) play bluegrass.</p> <p>I&#8217;d gotten the Stringduster&#8217;s latest record and listened to it a few times while planting the garden, but at the time it...
