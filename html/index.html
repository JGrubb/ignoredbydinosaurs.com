				<h2 id='4__john_digweed'>#4 - John Digweed</h2> <p>So this one&#8217;s might need a little explaining. I&#8217;ve said it here before, but it&#8217;s likely that you weren&#8217;t here for that - I went through a phase in college where I traveled all over the southeast going to see shows. I didn&#8217;t go to Phish shows except for a few times, and String Cheese was a bit after my time. I and my buddies went to go see DJs. This was the golden age of Keoki, Rabbit in the Moon, Simply Jeff, the Dubtribe Soundsystem, Scott Hardkiss.. My first party was to go see the Dubtribe at some club in Raleigh. I couldn&#8217;t figure out where the music was coming from the whole time, but it didn&#8217;t matter because I danced my ass off all night long. It was awesome.</p> <p>After a year or two of this and getting more established in the Boone music scene as a bassist, it occurred to me one night that perhaps I should pick up a pair of decks and figure out how to rock the crowd like these guys do. It was DJ Icey running the show at that particular time. From <a href='/2009/04/file-under-random-memory/'>another post</a> -</p> <blockquote> <p>I still remember this one record he played that night - the vocal hook was “can you feel the BASS”, and when the record said ‘bass’ there was this note that came out of the subs that can’t be related verbally. It shook the world. It made my hair stand up. It made the entire party, all 5000 of us, stop dancing and look around at each other.</p> </blockquote> <p>So anyway, pretty much like this whole software quest but somewhat more informed, I began groping about for a style and a sound.</p> <h2 id='local_influences'>Local influences</h2> <p>I had two good buddies...

				<h2 id='reasons_for_leaving_drupal_a_preamble'>Reasons for leaving Drupal, a preamble</h2> <p>I&#8217;d had this website on Drupal since some time in July. If you look through the <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/archive/'>archives</a>, you&#8217;ll notice a relative dearth of posts from this time period. Drupal just has a way of sucking all the fun out of blogging. It&#8217;s very, very slow for one thing. I had a lot of trouble integrating the site with the Disqus comment system that handled all of my Wordpress comments before I made the move so I was forced to use Drupal&#8217;s comment system. I&#8217;d written a couple of posts in the &#8220;didn&#8217;t find much in Google about it, so I decided to become the authoritative voice on it&#8221; vein, and had a ton of comments on one of them. Those comments appear to be gone now, even though I devoted an entire day to exporting them out of Drupal into Disqus with a <a href='http://drupal.org/node/269010' title='Migrate from Drupal comment.module to Disqus comments | drupal.org'>solution that someone came up with</a>.</p> <p>Basically, Drupal is a beast. If you have a project that you are trying to build that involves users with accounts, and different levels of access to the content based on those roles, go with Drupal. For anything else, anything simpler, stay away. Drupal gives the impression of being somehow more user friendly since you can configure these massively complex sites without actually coding much of anything, but is that really a good thing?? Drupal&#8217;s inherent dependence on <a href='http://developmentseed.org/blog/2009/jul/09/development-staging-production-workflow-problem-drupal' title='The Development -&amp;gt; Staging -&amp;gt; Production Workflow Problem in Drupal | Development Seed'>stashing so much configuration in the database</a> will be the death of the project if it&#8217;s not figured out, and I personally don&#8217;t think anything short of a MAJOR rewrite is going to sort it out. The major Drupal rewrite that&#8217;s...

			<div class="text">
				<p>Well, here we are. It was a tortuous migration, but IgnoredByDinosaurs (the blog) has reached version 5. I think it&#8217;s version 5, let&#8217;s see there was Blogger, then WP, then Drupal, then back to WP, then back to Drupal, and now this bad boy, so I guess you would call this one 6.0.</p> <p>This blog is now run by a system called <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>, a &#8220;site generator&#8221; that&#8217;s written in Ruby. What it does is take a bunch of text posts and runs them through a couple of different templates and spits out a full site of static HTML, since that&#8217;s mostly what a blog is anyway. It&#8217;s a <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/chapter1b/'>compiler</a> for your website. No webforms, no databases, no security updates. Just plain old HTML, like back in the good old days, but less hassle and more fun! I would have stayed with Drupal but honestly, it was just way too slow. This being just HMTL, without 119 database tables being joined by 200 different queries to display a blog post will be about a thousand times faster (literally).</p> <p>So anyway&#8230;</p> <h2 id='bass_influences'>Bass influences</h2> <p>I&#8217;ve been reading <a href='http://kylehollingsworth.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/hoppy-holidays-countdown/' title='Hoppy Holidays Countdown |'>Kyle Hollingsworth&#8217;s recent blog posts</a> with great interest. It&#8217;s always fun to see if who you think was an influence was truly such, but nobody ever posts these kinds of lists about <em>themselves</em>. Now that I&#8217;m on the verge of no longer being a defunct bassist, but rather a funct bassist, I thought I take a look back and see if I could boil it down to five bassists who pretty much wrote my play book.</p> <p>Long story short, I can&#8217;t. There&#8217;s a few non-bassists who have given me more ideas than many of the bassists I&#8217;ve grown up with. So here goes.</p> <h2 id='5_cliff_burton'>#5 Cliff Burton</h2> <p>I...

			<div class="text">
				<p>May I suggest you download this book &#8211; <a href='http://learnpythonthehardway.com/index'>Learn Python the Hard Way</a>? It&#8217;s got instructions in the very first bit about getting a decent, free text editor installed. TextEdit that comes with the Mac leaves quite a bit to be desired, and though I haven&#8217;t personally checked out <a href='http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/'>GEdit</a>, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a step up. Of course if you think you might want to get serious about this, or if you get serious about this down the line, may I suggest dropping $60 on <a href='http://macromates.com/'>TextMate</a>? I know it&#8217;s kind of a lot of money, but if you get into this stuff, it&#8217;s worth it.</p>

<p>May I also suggest that you go through the first few exercises? It&#8217;s fun to make your computer do things, however rudimentary, and doing them in the babystep fashion that this has you do eases you into programming geekery like the command line. It trains your fingers, it trains your eyes. It&#8217;s like that part in Rocky 4 where he goes to Siberia to toughen up against Drago.</p>

<p>Back soon. Cheers.</p>

			<div class="text">
				<p>Does anybody here want to build something? My buddy Jimmy of This Blog fame laid an idea on me the other night. He&#8217;s a teacher, and a fairly progressive, observant one at that. I believe him when he says that there&#8217;s nothing out there like this kinda simple, cool idea that he had. I think it must exist somewhere but it&#8217;s not being properly promoted if it does. So, I thought maybe it&#8217;d be a cool idea to try and teach him a little something about web development, and teach myself a lot in the process. There&#8217;s no way that this idea of his is currently within my grasp since a big part of the concept is an iOS app, but I don&#8217;t think the overall idea is really that far outside the realm of possibility. It&#8217;s going to need a web backend to it, anyway. So let&#8217;s see. Where to start?</p> <p>I think we&#8217;ll build it in Rails since I&#8217;ve learned enough about programming to know that I prefer Ruby as a language to PHP. I think this idea could easily be done in Drupal (a large, flexible content management system that&#8217;s built in PHP) as well, but for some reason the aesthetic of building the solution you need and no more is really appealing to me. Drupal takes care of a LOT of the stuff that we&#8217;re going to need to do upfront, things like user authentication (accounts) and interacting with a variety of different protocols - essential if the app phase is ever going to work. Drupal and Rails are both just pieces of software that run databases for you, but the difference is sorta like the difference between buying a really good loaf of bread and baking a really good loaf of bread. It doesn&#8217;t make...
