				<p>Regarding <a href='http://chrispandolfi.com/?p=567'>Pandolfi's recent pot stirrer</a>:</p> <p>It&#8217;s pretty much all been said out there, but I&#8217;ll tell you what gets me going to the point that I have to write about it. It&#8217;s when I read comments like this one -</p> <blockquote> <p>Bands like Railroad Earth, Green Sky, Yonder Mountain, Infamous Stringdusters, etc. are going to be labeled bluegrass and I think that&#8217;s fine&#8230;.as long as they understand where the roots of the music came from and they have an understanding and respect for that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Get stuffed. We&#8217;re all out here working as hard as we can to live doing what we love. You are the armchair quarterbacking internet dweller. For us to care about whether or not you approve of our reverence for tradition or the lack thereof would render us unable to do our jobs.</p> <p>Same dude, same comment -</p> <blockquote> <p>The only thing I wish is that these newer grassy bands stop all playing solely through pickups and get some high quality mics, like the Punch Brothers or the Jaybirds. I went to a Yonder Mountain show 2 weeks ago and I cringed every time I heard Jeff Austin solo with his pickup-burdened Nugget. He might of well had a Michael Kelly or something as it would have sounded the same. Sorry if that&#8217;s harsh&#8230;just not a big fan of his style or sound, I guess.</p> </blockquote> <p>We&#8217;ve already established our freedom to an opinion, but had you ever done any touring you&#8217;d probably have realized the technical and acoustical limitations of playing with live microphones on loud stages. They don&#8217;t make the sound better. Period. Ever. I&#8217;ve never heard of the Jaybirds, but I&#8217;m guessing the crowd that the Punch Brothers primarily plays to is a very quiet crowd. Good for them. Obviously some of...

				<blockquote> <p>Well unsurprisingly, even after several <em>minutes</em> of Google searching I&#8217;m unable to dig into the real article on this one, only countless verbatim reposts on countless web-scraping sites.</p> <p>Anyway, <a href='http://www.torontosun.com/entertainment/music/2011/03/15/17616986-wenn-story.html' title='Steve Jobs killed music: Bon Jovi | Music | Entertainment | Toronto Sun'>here&#8217;s an example</a>. I don&#8217;t hate on Jon Bon Jovi, but I do hate on the misrepresentation of facts. Steve Jobs didn&#8217;t kill the music industry, the music industry killed the music industry. Here&#8217;s how.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some time in the early 80s record companies and stereo manufacturers (then known as HiFi) found themselves with a problem. Record sales and HiFi sales were both flat. The somewhat endless parade of new media formats, the same on that continues today with Blueray, had not found a new winner in a while. People were still buying vinyl and cassettes.</p> <p>It was at an AES convention that the CD was introduced to the world for the sole purpose of reviving back catalog and HiFi sales. &#8220;But it sounds like a turd&#8221; was the general consensus among the crowd of professional audio engineers at AES. Analog to digital conversion was in it&#8217;s infancy and most early CDs sounded really brittle and really thin compared to their vinyl counterparts. Sound familiar? Anyway, because marketing is often more powerful than the truth especially when aimed at teenagers, the record companies got to work. &#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect copy&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;ll never wear out&#8221; was the message and it worked like a charm. By the late 80s the CD was the dominant format and back catalog sales were humming along.</p> <p>Presumably nobody in marketing foresaw an age where digital information would be so easy to transfer, or more likely they figured by then it wouldn&#8217;t be their problem.</p> <p>Not going to get all Lefsetz about Napster...

				<p>It has been a week. I&#8217;ve been working lately on a site for a non-prof out in California. Their mission is the spread of invasive plant species in California. I built them a system to allow the crowdsourcing of their Spring Nursery Survey, which is where they send folks out to various botanical nurseries around the state and make sure that they aren&#8217;t selling any plants that they shouldn&#8217;t be selling.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not illegal to sell invasive plant species, most of them are quite pretty. It&#8217;s only when they jump the garden fence and escape into the wild that they become a problem. Being invasive means basically that they grow totally out of control, a big problem in a wildfire prone state like CA.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, what I&#8217;ve done is build them a system that allows them to work a base of volunteers across the state to go out to nurseries and send back information about those nurseries and whether or not they&#8217;re selling some of this stuff that maybe they shouldn&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s an almost perfect use case for Drupal, so that kept me busy much of last month.</p>

<p>This month is two brand new clients from Austin, TX. One was already built and launched in a big old Wordpress sprint, and the other is my first legit &#8220;enterprise&#8221; client - a large Drupal setup on which I am now the sole developer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m ready to play some music, but it&#8217;s kind of a good thing for the bottom line that I can&#8217;t this month. The end of this month ushers in festival season for me. To say I&#8217;m excited is nowhere near enough.</p>

<p>I really need to work up a new design. Later&#8230;</p>

				<p>I might as well ditch this blog. I have no idea where to start another post. Is this a technology blog? Is this a blog about life as a musician? Is this still my rallying cry against the music industry? So much has gone on the last month/year/decade I don&#8217;t even know where to begin.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve joined a band. I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be doing that ever again. I actually thought my career as a professional player was over. I thought I&#8217;d seen the top of the mountain and that was that and it was time to move on into the next phase of my life, whatever that would be. I sort of had to jump out of the last phase of my life so quickly and so definitely that I didn&#8217;t have nearly the prep time I&#8217;d have liked to have had for that kind of thing. The result? Last year was one of the roughest of my entire life. <em>The</em> roughest.</p> <p>Then last year&#8217;s <a href='/2009/12/more-on-quitting-a-band/'>November surprise</a> ended up being another bass player in a band that I fit into pretty neatly.</p> <p>So here I am, back from the musical dead. I just had the most righteously good time in Big Sky MT at a bluegrass festival called Big Grass, and I&#8217;ll tell you what feels the best of all - feeling like part of a musical community. It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a born-again Stringdusters fan, so I was actually nervous when half of them were standing stageside while we were getting out set going last night. It was more an acute awareness that people were there and were listening, which is how nervousness tastes to me. But then we got some of them up, and a few more of them up, and a KILLER time was...
