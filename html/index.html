			<div class="text">
				<blockquote> <p>Just a week before the FCC holds a vote on whether to apply fairness rules to some of the nation’s internet service providers, two companies that sell their services to the country’s largest cellular companies showed off a different vision of the future: one where you’ll have to pay extra to watch YouTube or use Facebook.</p> </blockquote> <p>~From a <a href='http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/carriers-net-neutrality-tiers/' title='Mobile Carriers Dream of Charging per Page &amp;#124; Epicenter&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124; Wired.com'>Wired article</a> earlier this week. <strong>READ IT</strong></p> <h2 id='now_heres_why_this_matters'>Now here&#8217;s why this matters&#8230;</h2> <p>It&#8217;s not about Facebook or YouTube. Those seem on the surface like silly trifles and why shouldn&#8217;t we have to pay more for silly trifles, right? Because those silly, time-sucking trifles represent present-day American innovation. Our physical manufacturing sector has been almost completely moved offshore. This was done over a period of a couple of decades between Reagan and Bush II and was done for the sole reason of increasing corporate profits. If it&#8217;s cheaper to manufacture stuff somewhere they don&#8217;t have a minimum wage, and the prices here stay the same, the company makes more money for it&#8217;s shareholders. This seems like a good thing, unless you&#8217;re looking further than one fiscal quarter ahead.</p> <p>Now we have a situation where large Telecommunications companies have found a giant, largely unregulated loophole in the fastest growing sector of their business. They&#8217;d like for their share of the wireless spectrum to <em>remain</em> largely unregulated so that they can carve it up how they want and charge for it what they want. Seems fair, right? But remember this is our fucking AIR they&#8217;re charging us access to. They rightly realize that they majority of future internet use is going to take place over the airwaves, so best to get that sucker divvied up now and get the &#8220;best practices&#8221;...

				<h2 id='i_was_having_this_conversation_on_saturday'>I was having this conversation on Saturday&#8230;</h2> <p>I&#8217;m hanging with my new musical buddy George Kilby. He&#8217;s decided to upgrade his website so we&#8217;re doing a consult to get a feel for what direction we&#8217;re going to move him in (pardon my grammar). He said something at one point about a friend of his who&#8217;d decided to totally forgo having their own website in favor of just managing their presence through Facebook and a couple of other social sites.</p> <p>I&#8217;m kicking myself for not having a canned response as to why I think that&#8217;s a bad idea, but I guess i hadn&#8217;t really thought about it too much in a while.</p> <h2 id='in_my_humble_opinion'>In my humble opinion&#8230;</h2> <p>I can totally understand why an artist would do that. It&#8217;s a hassle to manage your own website. There&#8217;s tons of traffic already happening for free over on Facebook, they already have most of the goodies that a band website needs to have built for you, and you&#8217;ve got to spend half your life posting all this crap there <em>again</em> anyway. Why not just skip the middle man?</p> <p>To me it&#8217;s two things - branding and informational liberty.</p> <h3 id='branding'>Branding</h3> <p>If you fold up your own website and just manage your presence through mySpace or Facebook or Reverb Nation, you&#8217;re effectively subordinating your brand to theirs. I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that you are bigger than Facebook, but to me it almost implies that Facebook or MySpace owns you if you send your potential fans there instead of a property of your own. Would a &#8220;normal&#8221; business send people to MySpace instead of having their own site? No! They want to <em>make</em> money&#8230;</p> <h3 id='informational_liberty'>Informational liberty</h3> <p>I have some friends in a band.

			<div class="text">
				<h2 id='4__john_digweed'>#4 - John Digweed</h2> <p>So this one&#8217;s might need a little explaining. I&#8217;ve said it here before, but it&#8217;s likely that you weren&#8217;t here for that - I went through a phase in college where I traveled all over the southeast going to see shows. I didn&#8217;t go to Phish shows except for a few times, and String Cheese was a bit after my time. I and my buddies went to go see DJs. This was the golden age of Keoki, Rabbit in the Moon, Simply Jeff, the Dubtribe Soundsystem, Scott Hardkiss.. My first party was to go see the Dubtribe at some club in Raleigh. I couldn&#8217;t figure out where the music was coming from the whole time, but it didn&#8217;t matter because I danced my ass off all night long. It was awesome.</p> <p>After a year or two of this and getting more established in the Boone music scene as a bassist, it occurred to me one night that perhaps I should pick up a pair of decks and figure out how to rock the crowd like these guys do. It was DJ Icey running the show at that particular time. From <a href='/2009/04/file-under-random-memory/'>another post</a> -</p> <blockquote> <p>I still remember this one record he played that night - the vocal hook was “can you feel the BASS”, and when the record said ‘bass’ there was this note that came out of the subs that can’t be related verbally. It shook the world. It made my hair stand up. It made the entire party, all 5000 of us, stop dancing and look around at each other.</p> </blockquote> <p>So anyway, pretty much like this whole software quest but somewhat more informed, I began groping about for a style and a sound.</p> <h2 id='local_influences'>Local influences</h2> <p>I had two good buddies...

			<div class="text">
				<h2 id='reasons_for_leaving_drupal_a_preamble'>Reasons for leaving Drupal, a preamble</h2> <p>I&#8217;d had this website on Drupal since some time in July. If you look through the <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/archive/'>archives</a>, you&#8217;ll notice a relative dearth of posts from this time period. Drupal just has a way of sucking all the fun out of blogging. It&#8217;s very, very slow for one thing. I had a lot of trouble integrating the site with the Disqus comment system that handled all of my Wordpress comments before I made the move so I was forced to use Drupal&#8217;s comment system. I&#8217;d written a couple of posts in the &#8220;didn&#8217;t find much in Google about it, so I decided to become the authoritative voice on it&#8221; vein, and had a ton of comments on one of them. Those comments appear to be gone now, even though I devoted an entire day to exporting them out of Drupal into Disqus with a <a href='http://drupal.org/node/269010' title='Migrate from Drupal comment.module to Disqus comments | drupal.org'>solution that someone came up with</a>.</p> <p>Basically, Drupal is a beast. If you have a project that you are trying to build that involves users with accounts, and different levels of access to the content based on those roles, go with Drupal. For anything else, anything simpler, stay away. Drupal gives the impression of being somehow more user friendly since you can configure these massively complex sites without actually coding much of anything, but is that really a good thing?? Drupal&#8217;s inherent dependence on <a href='http://developmentseed.org/blog/2009/jul/09/development-staging-production-workflow-problem-drupal' title='The Development -&amp;gt; Staging -&amp;gt; Production Workflow Problem in Drupal | Development Seed'>stashing so much configuration in the database</a> will be the death of the project if it&#8217;s not figured out, and I personally don&#8217;t think anything short of a MAJOR rewrite is going to sort it out. The major Drupal rewrite that&#8217;s...

			<div class="text">
				<p>Well, here we are. It was a tortuous migration, but IgnoredByDinosaurs (the blog) has reached version 5. I think it&#8217;s version 5, let&#8217;s see there was Blogger, then WP, then Drupal, then back to WP, then back to Drupal, and now this bad boy, so I guess you would call this one 6.0.</p> <p>This blog is now run by a system called <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>, a &#8220;site generator&#8221; that&#8217;s written in Ruby. What it does is take a bunch of text posts and runs them through a couple of different templates and spits out a full site of static HTML, since that&#8217;s mostly what a blog is anyway. It&#8217;s a <a href='http://ignoredbydinosaurs.com/2009/03/chapter1b/'>compiler</a> for your website. No webforms, no databases, no security updates. Just plain old HTML, like back in the good old days, but less hassle and more fun! I would have stayed with Drupal but honestly, it was just way too slow. This being just HMTL, without 119 database tables being joined by 200 different queries to display a blog post will be about a thousand times faster (literally).</p> <p>So anyway&#8230;</p> <h2 id='bass_influences'>Bass influences</h2> <p>I&#8217;ve been reading <a href='http://kylehollingsworth.wordpress.com/2010/11/28/hoppy-holidays-countdown/' title='Hoppy Holidays Countdown |'>Kyle Hollingsworth&#8217;s recent blog posts</a> with great interest. It&#8217;s always fun to see if who you think was an influence was truly such, but nobody ever posts these kinds of lists about <em>themselves</em>. Now that I&#8217;m on the verge of no longer being a defunct bassist, but rather a funct bassist, I thought I take a look back and see if I could boil it down to five bassists who pretty much wrote my play book.</p> <p>Long story short, I can&#8217;t. There&#8217;s a few non-bassists who have given me more ideas than many of the bassists I&#8217;ve grown up with. So here goes.</p> <h2 id='5_cliff_burton'>#5 Cliff Burton</h2> <p>I...
