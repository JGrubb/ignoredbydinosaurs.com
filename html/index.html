				<p>I might as well ditch this blog. I have no idea where to start another post. Is this a technology blog? Is this a blog about life as a musician? Is this still my rallying cry against the music industry? So much has gone on the last month/year/decade I don&#8217;t even know where to begin.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve joined a band. I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be doing that ever again. I actually thought my career as a professional player was over. I thought I&#8217;d seen the top of the mountain and that was that and it was time to move on into the next phase of my life, whatever that would be. I sort of had to jump out of the last phase of my life so quickly and so definitely that I didn&#8217;t have nearly the prep time I&#8217;d have liked to have had for that kind of thing. The result? Last year was one of the roughest of my entire life. <em>The</em> roughest.</p> <p>Then last year&#8217;s <a href='/2009/12/more-on-quitting-a-band/'>November surprise</a> ended up being another bass player in a band that I fit into pretty neatly.</p> <p>So here I am, back from the musical dead. I just had the most righteously good time in Big Sky MT at a bluegrass festival called Big Grass, and I&#8217;ll tell you what feels the best of all - feeling like part of a musical community. It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a born-again Stringdusters fan, so I was actually nervous when half of them were standing stageside while we were getting out set going last night. It was more an acute awareness that people were there and were listening, which is how nervousness tastes to me. But then we got some of them up, and a few more of them up, and a KILLER time was...

				<blockquote>
<p>As business models go, there are currently two dominant ones: either people like your product enough to purchase it or they don’t care enough to buy it but will overlook its deficiencies if it’s “free” in exchange for their personal browsing and purchasing info sold to advertisers. The former model is Apple’s, the latter is Google’s.</p>

<p>Apple sells emotional experiences. The price is what users pay to be delighted by Apple’s stream of innovations and to be free of the lowest common denominator burdens and the pervasive harvesting of their personal info.</p>

<p>Google sells eyeballs. To be more precise, the clickstream attached to those eyeballs. Thus scale, indeed dominance, is absolutely crucial to Google’s model.</p>

				<h2 id='3_arcade_fire__the_suburbs'>#3 Arcade Fire - The Suburbs</h2> <p>I&#8217;ve never listened to these guys before. I&#8217;d been getting my indie rock fix from Death Cab and the Decemberists for the last couple of years and had never felt the urge to get any of their previous albums, but when their <a href='http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/' title='The Wilderness Downtown'>web video for &#8220;We Used To Wait&#8221;</a> came out I couldn&#8217;t stop watching it. It&#8217;s one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve seen done with the internet so far, and the tune behind the video was really good, too.</p> <p>After a couple of weeks I bought the whole album, listened to it a few times and put it away. It&#8217;s only been over the last 6 weeks or so that I put it on repeat, and this is a fantastic record. It&#8217;s got the right mix of tunes that get you immediately and tunes that take a while to realize that you love (like every great album). <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqnvaWZ-JA' title='YouTube - Arcade Fire - Month Of May'>The Month of May</a> in particular is custom made for setting record times on your jog&#8230;</p> <h2 id='2_infamous_stringdusters__things_that_fly'>#2 Infamous Stringdusters - Things That Fly</h2> <p>After I quit my last gig, I was feeling a little burned out on acoustic music. I didn&#8217;t listen to much besides hip hop and dance music for the first several months of this year, but then a strange thing started happening. Larry Keel would end up on repeat for several listens through his whole catalog. I started going through Tony Rice&#8217;s records, Bill Monroe&#8217;s records.. I was having an urge I&#8217;d never felt before - an urge to listen to and (gasp) play bluegrass.</p> <p>I&#8217;d gotten the Stringduster&#8217;s latest record and listened to it a few times while planting the garden, but at the time it...

				<blockquote> <p>Just a week before the FCC holds a vote on whether to apply fairness rules to some of the nation’s internet service providers, two companies that sell their services to the country’s largest cellular companies showed off a different vision of the future: one where you’ll have to pay extra to watch YouTube or use Facebook.</p> </blockquote> <p>~From a <a href='http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/12/carriers-net-neutrality-tiers/' title='Mobile Carriers Dream of Charging per Page &amp;#124; Epicenter&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124; Wired.com'>Wired article</a> earlier this week. <strong>READ IT</strong></p> <h2 id='now_heres_why_this_matters'>Now here&#8217;s why this matters&#8230;</h2> <p>It&#8217;s not about Facebook or YouTube. Those seem on the surface like silly trifles and why shouldn&#8217;t we have to pay more for silly trifles, right? Because those silly, time-sucking trifles represent present-day American innovation. Our physical manufacturing sector has been almost completely moved offshore. This was done over a period of a couple of decades between Reagan and Bush II and was done for the sole reason of increasing corporate profits. If it&#8217;s cheaper to manufacture stuff somewhere they don&#8217;t have a minimum wage, and the prices here stay the same, the company makes more money for it&#8217;s shareholders. This seems like a good thing, unless you&#8217;re looking further than one fiscal quarter ahead.</p> <p>Now we have a situation where large Telecommunications companies have found a giant, largely unregulated loophole in the fastest growing sector of their business. They&#8217;d like for their share of the wireless spectrum to <em>remain</em> largely unregulated so that they can carve it up how they want and charge for it what they want. Seems fair, right? But remember this is <em>our fucking AIR</em> they&#8217;re charging us to access. They rightly realize that they majority of future internet use is going to take place over the airwaves, so best to get that sucker divvied up now and get the &#8220;best practices&#8221;...
