<article class="blog">
  <p>This one is for my buddy, Bob. Bob is an old school developer who has recently been baptized by the cooling waters of the web. He&#8217;s building a site in Wordpress, so I thought I&#8217;d post a few relevant pieces of info up here for him, and those of his ilk.</p>

<p>First of all, realize that Posts and Pages are almost the exact same thing. The key difference between the two as far as I can tell is not that Pages are easier to add to the top-level navigation, but that Posts allow you to classify them with &#8220;Categories&#8221;. This allows Wordpress to work it&#8217;s relational database magic, and in the hands of a skilled template author you can really take a very simple system and make it produce just about any listing of content that you want. When in the early stages of developing a site, it&#8217;s better to take what you&#8217;d think of as top-level content items and see if there&#8217;s any way that you can make it a listing of Posts in a certain Category, rather than just dumping related info on one Page. The chief advantages of working this way are maintenance and search-ability.</p>

<p>The <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/'>Wordpress Codex</a> is a wonderfully organized place to learn a lot about authoring templates. Most of the Wordpress core is basically just a large group of functions for talking to a database, and much of the magic of pulling the info back out in the way that you want it is in the template layer. Thus, the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation'>Theme Development</a> section of the Codex is the place to spend a couple of days getting used to the way Wordpress works.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d suggest downloading my very <a href='http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme'>bare bones base theme</a> and stepping through some of the template files while browsing the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags'>Template Tags function reference</a>. It may not make sense immediately, but it won&#8217;t take long.</p>
