  <h2>More on Wordpress</h2>
  <p>Posted: <time>01 Oct 2010</time></p>
  <p>This one is for my buddy, Bob.  Bob is an old school developer who has recently been baptized by the cooling waters of the web.  He's building a site in Wordpress, so I thought I'd post a few relevant pieces of info up here for him, and those of his ilk.</p><p>First of all, realize that Posts and Pages are almost the exact same thing.  The key difference between the two as far as I can tell is not that Pages are easier to add to the top-level navigation, but that Posts allow you to classify them with "Categories".  This allows Wordpress to work it's relational database magic, and in the hands of a skilled template author you can really take a very simple system and make it produce just about any listing of content that you want.  When in the early stages of developing a site, it's better to take what you'd think of as top-level content items and see if there's any way that you can make it a listing of Posts in a certain Category, rather than just dumping related info on one Page.  The chief advantages of working this way are maintenance and search-ability.</p><p>The <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/'>Wordpress Codex</a> is a wonderfully organized place to learn a lot about authoring templates.  Most of the Wordpress core is basically just a large group of functions for talking to a database, and much of the magic of pulling the info back out in the way that you want it is in the template layer.  Thus, the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Developer_Documentation'>Theme Development</a> section of the Codex is the place to spend a couple of days getting used to the way Wordpress works.</p><p>I'd suggest downloading my very <a href='http://github.com/JGrubb/Base-WP-theme'>bare bones base theme</a> and stepping through some of the template files while browsing the <a href='http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags'>Template Tags function reference</a>.  It may not make sense immediately, but it won't take long.</p>
