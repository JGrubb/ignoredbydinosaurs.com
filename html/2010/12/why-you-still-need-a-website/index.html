  	<h2 id='i_was_having_this_conversation_on_saturday'>I was having this conversation on Saturday&#8230;</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m hanging with my new musical buddy George Kilby. He&#8217;s decided to upgrade his website so we&#8217;re doing a consult to get a feel for what direction we&#8217;re going to move him in (pardon my grammar). He said something at one point about a friend of his who&#8217;d decided to totally forgo having their own website in favor of just managing their presence through Facebook and a couple of other social sites.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m kicking myself for not having a canned response as to why I think that&#8217;s a bad idea, but I guess i hadn&#8217;t really thought about it too much in a while.</p>

<h2 id='in_my_humble_opinion'>In my humble opinion&#8230;</h2>

<p>I can totally understand why an artist would do that. It&#8217;s a hassle to manage your own website. There&#8217;s tons of traffic already happening for free over on Facebook, they already have most of the goodies that a band website needs to have built for you, and you&#8217;ve got to spend half your life posting all this crap there <em>again</em> anyway. Why not just skip the middle man?</p>

<p>To me it&#8217;s two things - branding and informational liberty.</p>

<h3 id='branding'>Branding</h3>

<p>If you fold up your own website and just manage your presence through mySpace or Facebook or Reverb Nation, you&#8217;re effectively subordinating your brand to theirs. I don&#8217;t mean to suggest that you are bigger than Facebook, but to me it almost implies that Facebook or MySpace owns you if you send your potential fans there instead of a property of your own. Would a &#8220;normal&#8221; business send people to MySpace instead of having their own site? No! They want to <em>make</em> money&#8230;</p>

<h3 id='informational_liberty'>Informational liberty</h3>

<p>I have some friends in a band. They&#8217;ve moved their main website onto a platform called Ning. Ning is a well funded company that aims to make the process of building a &#8220;social network&#8221; something that anyone can do. It&#8217;s sort of like the old days of having your own message board on your site, except with the features one would expect of a modern social network. They have a pretty decent system for listing their tour dates, and maintaining the info is pretty easy. It doesn&#8217;t cost that much and it works well, so what&#8217;s the problem?</p>

<p>What if they every want to do something different? What happens when the day comes that they want to do something that Ning won&#8217;t let them do (or won&#8217;t let them do at a price they can afford), like maybe host and sell their own digital downloads or build a design template that&#8217;s outside the parameters of what Ning allows?</p>

<p>They&#8217;re faced with a tough decision. On the one hand they don&#8217;t have access to tools that they&#8217;d like to use to promote their band. On the other hand they shutter a social network that they&#8217;ve asked their fans to join and be a part of, one that has been a definite success so far. Maybe it&#8217;s not an issue right now and maybe it won&#8217;t be that big of one ever, but by inviting their fans to create a community around them using proprietary software that they&#8217;ll never fully control they&#8217;re rolling the dice that Ning (or whoever ultimately buys Ning) will continue to do them and their fans right.</p>

<h2 id='in_summary'>In summary</h2>

<p>Better to build your own site and use that as the hub around which you organize the rest of your social accessories.</p>
