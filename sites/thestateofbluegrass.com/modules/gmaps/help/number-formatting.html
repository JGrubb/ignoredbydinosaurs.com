<p>The following rules will apply to all input fields that have numeric value.</p>
<p>GMaps supports the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/format_number">Format Number API project</a> in number formatting. If
that modules is enabled than you can use localized decimal and thousand separators. If that module is not exists,
than you can use "." (dot, or full stop) as decimal and "," (comma) or " " (space, no-break space) as thousand separator.
You can use in both case the usual math signs, "+" (plus) and "-" (minus) to mark positive and negative values.</p>
