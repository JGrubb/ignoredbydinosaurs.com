This module allows you to set some meta tags for the different resources exposed
by your site: nodes, users, views, taxonomy filters and error pages are some
examples.

Giving more attention to the important keywords and/or description on your site
allows you to get better search engine positioning (given that you really only
provide the keywords which exist in the content itself, and do not try to lie).

This version of the module only works with Drupal 6.x.

Starting from nodewords-5.x-1.9 the following modules extend the nodewords
functionality:

- Meta tags Node Type, by Ariel Barreiro
- Meta Tags by Path, by Shannon Lucas

The latest development snapshot (6.x-1.x-dev), and version 6.x-1.1 or higher
implement a functionality similar to the one implemented in the module
Meta Tags by Path, which is not anymore required for those versions.

To assure compatibility between Nodewords and Meta tags Node Type, use the
latest version available of Nodewords and Meta tags Node Type; previous versions
were not compatible with the recent changes in Nodewords.
